\chapter{Introduction}
\label{iii}

Cold and Ultracold molecules have long promised a wealth of new opportunity to the AMO physics community, and are now truly blossoming in this regard. Associated ultracold atoms are available at unprecedented phase space densities, as are directly laser-coolable molecules. This in turn imposes some welcome pressure on experiments with species directly cooled and decelerated to finally deliver on promises of high density and in-trap collisions.

\section{Direct Cooling}

Direct cooling refers to the preparation of molecules of interest at typical temperatures and subsequent additional cooling. This is in contrast to associative type methods which first cool constituents atoms.

\section{Laser Cooling}

Much progress has been made using laser cooling methods directly on molecules.

\section{Association}
