\chapter{Background}
\label{bbb}

All of our ability to successfully exploit and manipulate OH radicals is underpinned by a robust understanding of its internal structure undergirded by decades of careful spectroscopy.

\section{Molecular Hamiltonians}

\section{Angular Momentum Coupling}

In addition to the nice descriptions available in earlier theses, I'd like to leave my mark by including for the first time animations of molecular angular motion that are faithful to the real thing except for time rescaling.

\section{Molecular Collisions}
