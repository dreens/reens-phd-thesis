\chapter{Hexapole Focusing}
\label{chapter:hex}

And it came to pass that all those molecules who contrived to survive the great segregation described in the previous chapter, were set about a grueling and strenuous exertion of the mental faculties. Indeed, the focus requested of them was of such a severity as to literally bend their wills and their trajectories. And in more modern terminology, the subject of this chapter is the focusing of molecular beams for optimized coupling between their source and any ensuing scientific apparatus.

\section{Phase Space Matching}

To understand the action and possible usefulness of a hexapole, it is essential to become familiar with thinking and working in phase space.
By phase space I simply mean the two dimensional space spanned by the position of molecules in the ensemble on one axis and their velocity on the other.
Technically speaking phase space ought to refer to the position-momentum space, but for SI units and for our very light particles velocity makes much more sense.
The usefulness of working in phase space stems from the straightforward correlation between the various transformations that may be applied to the ensemble and how they are manifested in phase space, as is summed up in Tab.~\ref{phasespacetable}.
Free propagation results in molecules with larger velocity coordinate deviating towards larger spatial coordinate, and vice versa.
I always work in the frame of reference of the ensemble, so that the centroid of the initial ensemble is assigned the $(0,0)$ coordinate.
The action of a hexapole is to create a spring-like harmonic restoring force in the transverse directions, in which case it may be proven that motion in phase space is circular, provided the velocity axis is scaled by the angular frequency of the harmonic restoring force into spatial units: $v` = v/\omega$.
Beginning with the spring-like restoring force:
\begin{equation}
\ddot{x} = -kx/m_\text{OH} = -\omega^2x,
\end{equation}
and obtaining the solution for the position and velocity under simple harmonic motion:
\begin{equation}
x(t) = \sin(\omega t + \phi),\qquad v(t) =\dot{x}(t) = \omega\cos(\omega t + \phi).
\end{equation}
If we now scale the velocity units by $\omega$, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\biggl(x(t)\biggr)^2 + \left(\frac{v(t)}{\omega}\right)^2\quad = \quad\sin^2(\omega t + \phi) + \cos^2(\omega t + \phi)\quad =\quad 1.
\end{equation}
By appropriately choosing the frequency of the hexapole and the length of time spent within, it is possible to prepare the ensemble for a revival of the initial distribution after some additional free propagation afterwards, see the third and fourth rows of Tab.~\ref{phasespacetable}.

Furthermore, it is possible to engineer the applications of hexapole rotation and free flights to achieve compression along one axis, accompanied by density preserving dilation in the opposite axis.
These results parallel the magnification or demagnification of an image achieved by a lens between an image and object plane depending on whether the lens is positioned closer to the image or the object plane.
One key distinction however between the behavior of an optical lens and that of a hexapolar lens is that the latter is almost never operated in the short-lens regime, which has a significant impact on how one thinks about its behavior.
Molecules are often rapidly transiting a hexapole in the longitudinal direction, which means that the device needs to be long in order to apply the desired rotation of the transverse phase space.
By carefully following an ABCD matrix approach, instead of a simple lens-maker equation for the locations of image and object planes, we obtain~\citep[Eq.~9]{Kirste2013}:
\begin{equation}
L_3 = \frac{L_1+\frac{1}{\kappa}\tan(\kappa L_2)}{L_1\kappa\tan(\kappa L_2)-1},
\end{equation}
where $\kappa=\omega/v$ is an inverse length unit directly related to the hexapole strength and inversely to the beam speed, and the $L_i$ are as described in Fig.~\ref{hexdefinitions.png}.
In the limit of small $L_2$, this equation can be reduced to something more familiar.
First, using $\tan(x)\sim x$,
\begin{equation}
L_3 = \frac{L_1+L_2}{L_1L_2\kappa^2-1}= \frac{L_1}{L_1L_2\kappa^2-1},
\end{equation}
and now inverting,
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{L_3} = L_2\kappa^2 - \frac{1}{L_1},
\end{equation}
so that for $f_H=1/L_2\kappa^2$ we recover the lensmaker formula:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{L_1}+\frac{1}{L_3}=\frac{1}{f_H}.
\end{equation}
This focal length has the dependences we would expect, since it reduces (i.e. the lens strengthens) with larger $L_2$ or with larger $\omega$.

This compression of velocity and dilation of position or vice versa is what is known as phase space matching, and is in principle useful for optimizing the transfer of molecules in an ensemble between a source and a device, or between devices.
To flesh this out a bit further, all the devices worked with in the laboratory can be characterized by a phase space acceptance, in principal a six dimensional region but in practice only ever considered two dimensions at a time.
The phase space acceptance typical of the Stark decelerator for example is indicated in Fig.~\ref{phasespaceexamp.png}, and discussed further in Chap.~\ref{chapter:slowing}.
Unfortunately the phase space generated by a supersonic expansion is rather difficult to ascertain, as discussed previously in Chapt.~\ref{chapter:sourcing}.
One thing which can be said for certain however is that the initial transverse velocity width generated by the supersonic expansion is much larger relative to anything else in the experiment.
This follows from simple intuition as the supersonic expansion only generates a mildly directed beam, which therefore expands significantly transversely away from the valve.
Projected onto transverse phase space, such an ensemble should have a variation of transverse velocity that is on the same order as the forward velocity of the beam, i.e. hundreds of m/s, compared with tens of m/s for the typical depths of devices made with laboratory electric fields.
Nonetheless, the valve may still generate a distribution that is quite narrow in its initial transverse spatial spread.
If the initial distribution is narrower spatially than the $2$~mm of the decelerator, there will be opportunities for an improved loading of the decelerator with appropriate magnification of the device designed to compress velocity and dilate position as in row 5 of Tab.~\ref{phasespacetable}.

\figdave{phasespaceexamp.png}{Transverse Phase Space Acceptance Examples}{Transverse phase space acceptance of a Stark decelerator operated in various modes. Each mode has a different characteristic ratio of velocity width to spatial width. Some colors are hard to perceive, but all have a width close to $2$~mm and varying heights between $10$ and $30$~m/s.}{10cm}

\section{History}

In the first generation of the experiment, a $5$~cm hexapole was employed and successfully enhanced the molecule number just afterwards by as much as a factor of $16$~\citep[Fig.~6]{Bochinski2004}.
What is less clear however is whether this enhancement really exceeds what could have been had by simply mounting the decelerator closer to the valve and skipping the hexapole entirely.
By the time Hao and I were running the second generation of the experiment~\cite{Sawyer2007}, the hexapole was only providing a $17\%$ effect, as shown in Fig.~\ref{nohexeffect.png}.
I can find no earlier record of the performance of this hexapole, so it is difficult to say whether this observation of no effect with the voltage on/off stems from some HV issue that developed later, from transition between Jordan and PZT valves, or an alignment issue or some other effect.

\figdave{nohexeffect.png}{No Hexapole Effect in Generation Two}{Three traces showing OH population after bunching with the hexapole set at different voltages. A scant $17\%$ effect is observed.}{14cm}

If it is indeed the case that the hexapole in the second generation decelerator never had a significant effect, there are a few possible explanations.
One relates to the influence of skimmer clogging, which can alter the trajectories of molecules so that they appear to have originated from the skimmer tip.
The skimmer tip is too close to the hexapole relative to its focal length for it to have much influence, hence the observation of little effect.
Another possibility is that the initial distribution of molecules in transverse phase space is simply much larger than the phase space acceptance of the decelerator, so that even with no hexapole and pure free propagation, the initial distribution still thoroughly overlaps the acceptance of the decelerator.
This explanation would even jive with the observed influence of the hexapole in~\citep[Fig.~6]{Bochinski2004}, since that observation was made with a detector directly after the hexapole.
This detector could have observed a legitimate hexapole induced spatial density enhancement, but entirely composed of molecules with transverse velocities above the threshold for decelerator acceptance.


\section{Modernity}

Against this dubious backdrop, we decided in the summer of 2018 to begin work on a new hexapole for use with the third generation decelerator.
Our motivations were quite different however from those that motivated the poorly performing hexapole of the second generation.
Instead of seeking to optimize coupling between the valve and decelerator, we were seeking to intentionally distance the two for the sake of reduced clogging potential, without sacrificing the gains in phase space density we had obtained by cryogenically cooling the skimmer.
This was largely motivated by observation of significant decelerator clogging, as described previously in Chap.~\ref{chapter:segregation}.
The new hexapole would this require cooling to cryogenic temperatures, so as to avoid the clogging observed in the decelerator.
In a sense, one can think of the cryogenic hexapole as comparable to cryogenically cooling the decelerator, only much more practically attainable.

I was able to rather quickly cycle through hexapole designs thanks to rapid manufacturing services and a well-integrated design for manufacturing approach.
I begin by describing features common to the two and a half hexapoles tried out over the past year.
Firstly, the obvious- a hexapole consists of six alternately charged poles, which generates close to the axis an electric field with the functional form:
\begin{equation}
\left|\vec{E}(r)\right| = 3V_0\left(\frac{r^2}{r_0^3}\right),
\end{equation}
where $V_0$ is the magnitude of the voltage to which each rod is charged, with alternating sign, and $r_0$ is the smallest radius which reaches from the axis to the surface of a pin.
For a molecule with a linear response to the electric field, this quadratic dependence of the electric field magnitude results in a harmonic potential, with the exception of the relatively small region close to the axis where the field is too small to polarize the molecules.
This exception causes a perturbation to the ideal focusing behavior, but is not very significant for OH~\citep[Fig.~2b]{Bochinski2004}, although more so for other species~\citep[Fig.~1]{Kirste2013}.
Specifically, with $V_0=13$~kV and $r_0=5$~mm, which lead to the typical field strengths characteristic of our traps and decelerators, electric fields up to $100$~kV/cm are generated, compared to $3$~kV/cm for polarizing the radical.

\subsection{Cryogenic Hexapole 1}

My first attempt at a cryogenic hexapole design leveraged some rather complex technologies.
Fearing the possibility of gas mediated discharge of the hexapole electrodes due to the high densities of molecules shortly after the skimmer, I planned to have the electrodes encased in sapphire tubes, so as to avoid the availability of conduction electrons at their surfaces.
These sapphire tubes would in turn sit within a copper block, for maximal thermal conductivity, mechanical alignment, and to provide additional adsorbing surfaces for the Neon.
The fields generated in the planned configuration at its intended voltages are shown in Fig.~\ref{hex1fields.png}.
In panel (a), note how the fields inside the sapphire are particularly small, a byproduct of its large dielectric constant close to $11$.
In panel (b), the electric fields along two axes are shown, one through the electrodes and the other between them.
A quadratic guiding curve is also shown, which corresponds to an angular trapping frequency for OH radicals of $\omega=20.6$~kHz.

This all of course requires patterning of a honeycomb-like structure on the inside of a long copper block, something which may be readily achieved using a technique known as wire electric discharge machining, wherein a thin sacrificial wire at high voltage is used like a bandsaw blade, and is slowly moved through another metal.
Electric discharges between the wire and the metal being cut cause material to be removed, and the wire is constantly fed so as to avoid its disintegration.
This was achieved according to our specifications without any hitches by the CIRES shop, a shop located at the time of this writing in the chemistry department at CU.

Some of the thermal considerations pertinent to the design are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{hex1heatloads.png}.
The final mechanical design differs slightly from what is shown in this figure, but the thermal considerations remain the same.
The large copper block within which the hexapole sits has a skimmer affixed to the front and an aperture to the back, and a large clamp-like structure conveys sufficient thermal conductivity without requiring Indium solder.
The emissivities guessed for the surfaces shown in panel (b) of Fig.~\ref{hex1heatloads.png} turned out to be optimistic, perhaps because they were approximate room temperature emissivities and not cryogenic, or maybe due to adsorbed gas layers further increasing emissivities.
A key challenge of the design pertains to how voltage is to be fed into the electrodes located inside the sapphire tubes.
A few iterations were made on the design before this was achieved with acceptable surface path-length reduction and suitable mechanical rigidity.
The HV distribution rings visible in Fig.~\ref{hex1heatloads.png} ended up having too much flexibility on their own, so plastic Ultem cuffs were glued directly onto the Sapphire rods, simultaneously increasing surface path length for arcs and adding the required rigidity.

An additional consideration for the hexapole is the matter of its alignment with the beamline.
There are two primary ways that satisfactory alignment may be obtained:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Contrive a way for alignment to be tweaked from outside of the vacuum chamber, so that final alignment may be guided by actual system figures of merit such as molecule yield after the hexapole. \label{hexitem1}
\item Provide in-vacuum fine-adjust knobs only, and engineer a protocol by which alignment may be obtained before pump-down, and not subsequently lost during either pump-down or cool-down. \label{hexitem2}
\end{enumerate}
Strategy~(\ref{hexitem1}) was employed for our cryogenic skimming work as described previously in Chap.~\ref{chapter:segregation}, but was deemed insufficient for this hexapole work, primarily due to unavailability of the requisite degrees of freedom.
Unlike the skimmer, which only really requires two translational degrees of freedom in order to achieve beam alignment, the hexapole has four alignment parameters, and potentially five depending on whether it is desirable to translate the device along the beam.
There seemed no straightforward way to achieve this across the vacuum envelope, especially given how far above the hexapole the tuning bellows sits.
