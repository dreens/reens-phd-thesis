abstract = {The accurate calculation of transmission probabilities of ducts in the molecular flow regime has become a need of vacuum standards on the ultrahigh vacuum region. The usual approach is to simulate a molecular flow of molecules with a Monte Carlo method, because of the difficulties that arise trying to find a solution of the Clausing integral equation in a system of a given geometry. As modern computers increase their speed, the accuracy of Monte Carlo methods is getting higher. It is therefore important to compare simulation results with data obtained by other methods to check that pseudorandom numbers generated are uniformly distributed and not correlated. We have applied both a Monte Carlo method and numerical methods to solve the Clausing integral equation for cylindrical and conical tubes. Both Monte Carlo and numerical methods are consistent within estimated uncertainties. In the case of conical ducts, we obtain values which agree very well with values found in the literature and with uncertainties several orders of magnitude smaller. In the case of cylinders, very accurate transmission probabilities are obtained solving numerically the Clausing integral equation. Comparing with other values found in the literature using a variational method, our values are near the upper bound and quite far away from the lower bound.},

abstract = {The Standard Model of particle physics is known to be incomplete. Extensions to the Standard Model, such as weak-scale supersymmetry, posit the existence of new particles and interactions that are asymmetric under time reversal (T) and nearly always predict a small yet potentially measurable electron electric dipole moment (EDM), d e , in the range of 10 −27 to 10 −30 e{\textperiodcentered}cm. The EDM is an asymmetric charge distribution along the electron spin (S →) that is also asymmetric under T. Using the polar molecule thorium monoxide, we measured d e = (-2.1 T 3.7 stat T 2.5 syst) × 10 −29 e{\textperiodcentered}cm. This corresponds to an upper limit of jd e j < 8.7 × 10 −29 e{\textperiodcentered}cm with 90% confidence, an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity relative to the previous best limit. Our result constrains T-violating physics at the TeV energy scale. T he exceptionally high internal effective electric field E eff of heavy neutral atoms and molecules can be used to precisely probe for the electron electric dipole moment (EDM), d e , via the energy shift U ¼ −d → e ⋅ → E eff , where d → e ¼ d e S → =ðℏ=2Þ, S → is electron spin, and ℏ is the reduced Planck constant. Valence electrons travel relativistically near the heavy nucleus, making E eff up to a million times the size of any static laboratory field (1-3). The previous best limits on d e came from experiments with thallium (Tl) atoms (4) (jd e j < 1.6 × 10 −27 e{\textperiodcentered}cm) and ytterbium fluoride (YbF) molecules (5, 6) (jd e j < 1.06 × 10 −27 e{\textperiodcentered}cm). The latter demonstrated that molecules can be used to suppress the motional electric fields and geometric phases that limited the Tl measurement (5) [this suppression is also present in certain atoms (7)]. Insofar as polar molecules can be fully polarized in laboratory-scale electric fields, E eff can be much greater than in atoms. The H 3 D 1 electronic state in the thorium monoxide (ThO) molecule provides an E eff ≈ 84 GV/cm, larger than those previously used in EDM measurements (8, 9). This state's unusually small magnetic moment reduces its sensitivity to spurious magnetic fields (10, 11). Improved systematic error rejection is possible because internal state selection allows the reversal of → E eff with no change in the laboratory electric field (12, 13). To measure d e , we perform a spin precession measurement (10, 14, 15) on pulses of 232 Th 16 O molecules from a cryogenic buffer gas beam source (16-18). The molecules pass between parallel plates that generate a laboratory electric field E z z % (Fig. 1A). A coherent superposition of two spin states, corresponding to a spin aligned in the xy plane, is prepared using optical pumping and state preparation lasers. Parallel electric (→ E) and magnetic (→ B) fields exert torques on the electric and magnetic dipole moments, causing the spin vector to precess in the xy plane. The precession angle is measured with a readout laser and fluorescence detection. A change in this angle as → E eff is reversed is proportional to d e. In more detail, a laser beam (wavelength 943 nm) optically pumps molecules from the ground electronic state into the lowest rotational level, J = 1, of the metastable (lifetime $\sim$2 ms) electronic H 3 D 1 state manifold (Fig. 1B), in an incoherent mixture of the˜Nthe˜ the˜N ¼ T1, M = T1 states. M is the angular momentum projection along the z % axis. ˜ N refers to the internuclear axis, n %, aligned (+1) or antialigned (-1) with respect to → E , when j → E j ≳ 1 V/cm (11). The linearly polarized state preparation laser's frequency is resonant with the H → C transition at 1090 nm (Fig. 1B). Within the short-lived (500 ns) electronic C state, there are two opposite-parity˜Pparity˜ parity˜P = T1 states with J = 1, M = 0. For a given spin precession measurement, the laser frequency determines the˜Nthe˜ the˜N and˜Pand˜ and˜P states that are addressed. This laser optically pumps the bright Fig. 1. Schematic of the apparatus and energy level diagram. (A) A collimated pulse of ThO molecules enters a magnetically shielded region (not to scale). An aligned spin state (smallest red arrows), prepared via optical pumping, precesses in parallel electric and magnetic fields. The final spin alignment is read out by a laser with rapidly alternating linear polarizations, X % and Y % , with the resulting fluorescence collected and detected with photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs). (B) The state preparation and readout lasers (double-lined blue arrows) drive one molecule orientatio{\~{n}} N ¼ AE1 (split by 2DE $\sim$ 100 MHz, where D is the electric dipole moment of the H state) in the H state to C, with parity˜Pparity˜ parity˜P = T1 (split by 50 MHz). Population in the C state decays via spontaneous emission, and we detect the resulting fluorescence (red wiggly arrow). H state levels are accompanied by cartoons displaying the orientation of → E eff (blue arrows) and the spin of the electron (red arrows) that dominantly contributes to the d e shift.},

abstract = {The interplay of magnetic exchange interactions and tunneling underlies many complex quantum phenomena observed in real materials. We study nonequilibrium magnetization dynamics in an extended two-dimensional (2D) system by loading effective spin-1/2 bosons into a spin-dependent optical lattice and use the lattice to separately control the resonance conditions for tunneling and superexchange. After preparing a nonequilibrium antiferromagnetically ordered state, we observe relaxation dynamics governed by two well-separated rates, which scale with the parameters associated with superexchange and tunneling. With tunneling off-resonantly suppressed, we observe superexchange-dominated dynamics over two orders of magnitude in magnetic coupling strength. Our experiment will serve as a benchmark for future theoretical work as the detailed dynamics of this 2D, strongly correlated, and far-from-equilibrium quantum system remain out of reach of current computational techniques. T he interplay of spin and motion underlies some of the most intriguing and poorly understood behaviors in many-body quan-tum systems (1). A well-known example is the onset of superconductivity in cuprate compounds when mobile holes are introduced into an otherwise insulating two-dimensional (2D) quantum magnet (2). Understanding this behav-ior is particularly challenging because the insu-lating state has strong quantum spin fluctuations, and the introduction of holes impedes the use of numerically exact techniques for quantum-correlated systems in more than one dimension. Ultracold atoms in optical lattices realize tun-able, idealized models of such behavior and can naturally operate in a regime where the quantum motion (tunneling) of particles and magnetic interactions (superexchange) appear simulta-neously (3, 4). For ultracold atoms in equilibrium, the ex-tremely small energy scale associated with super-exchange interactions makes the observation of magnetism challenging, and short-range antifer-romagnetic correlations resulting from super-exchange have only recently been observed (5, 6). Out-of-equilibrium superexchange-dominated dy-namics has been demonstrated in isolated pairs of atoms (7), in 1D systems with single-atom spin impurities (8), and recently in the decay of},

abstract = {The singularity of cylindrical or spherical coordinate systems at the origin imposes certain regularity conditions on the spectral expansion of any infinitely differentiable function. There are two efficient choices of a set of radial basis functions suitable for discretising the solution of a partial differential equation posed in either such geometry. One choice is methods based on standard Chebyshev polynomials; although these may be efficiently computed using fast transforms, differentiability to all orders of the obtained solution at the origin is not guaranteed. The second is the so-called one-sided Jacobi polynomials that explicitly satisfy the required behavioural conditions. In this paper, we compare these two approaches in their accuracy, differentiability and computational speed. We find that the most accurate and concise representation is in terms of one-sided Jacobi polynomials. However, due to the lack of a competitive fast transform, Chebyshev methods may be a better choice for some computationally intensive timestepping problems and indeed will yield sufficiently (although not infinitely) differentiable solutions provided they are adequately converged. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Outgassing rates of three low-carbon steels were measured using rate-of-rise and throughput meth-ods. Outgassing rates of water vapor during pump-down were higher than those of stainless steels, probably due to the nature of native surface oxide layer. However, hydrogen outgassing rates with-out a high temperature pretreatment were as low as (1–4) {\^{A}} 10 {\`{A}}10 Pa m 3 s {\`{A}}1 m {\`{A}}2 , which is much lower than that of untreated stainless steels. No dramatic reduction was observed in H 2 outgassing after vacuum annealing at 850 C for 12 h, suggesting that the low-carbon steels had been fully degassed during the steelmaking processes. This may be due to the use of the Ruhrstahl-Hausen vacuum process during steel refining instead of an older process, such as argon-oxygen decarburi-zation. The extremely low H 2 outgassing rate from low-carbon steels makes them applicable for use in ultrahigh vacuum or even extreme high vacuum applications, particularly where magnetic field shielding is needed.

@article{Barry2013,
abstract = {Laser cooling and trapping are central to modern atomic physics. It has been roughly three decades since laser cooling techniques produced ultracold atoms, leading to rapid advances in a vast array of fields and a number of Nobel prizes. Prior to the work presented in this thesis, laser cooling had not yet been extended to molecules because of their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules potentially useful for a wide range of applications. The first direct laser cooling of a molecule and further results we present here provide a new route to ultracold temperatures for molecules. In particular, these methods bridge the gap between ultracold temperatures and the approximately 1 kelvin temperatures attainable with directly cooled molecules (e.g. with cryogenic buffer gas cooling or decelerated supersonic beams). Using the carefully chosen molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF), decays to unwanted vibrational states are suppressed. Driving a transition with rotational quantum number R=1 to an excited state with R'=0 eliminates decays to unwanted rotational states. The dark ground-state Zeeman sublevels present in this specific scheme are remixed via a static magnetic field. Using three lasers for this scheme, a given molecule should undergo an average of approximately 100,000 photon absorption/emission cycles before being lost via unwanted decays. This number of cycles should be sufficient to load a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of molecules. In this thesis, we demonstrate transverse cooling of an SrF beam, in both Doppler and a Sisyphus-type cooling regimes. We also realize longitudinal slowing of an SrF beam. Finally, we detail current progress towards trapping SrF in a MOT. Ultimately, this technique should enable the production of large samples of molecules at ultracold temperatures for molecules chemically distinct from competing methods.},

abstract = {The presence of young massive stars orbiting on eccentric rings within a few tenths of a parsec of the supermassive black hole in the galactic center is challenging for theories of star formation. The high tidal shear from the black hole should tear apart the molecular clouds that form stars elsewhere in the Galaxy, and transport of stars to the galactic center also appears unlikely during their lifetimes. We conducted numerical simulations of the infall of a giant molecular cloud that interacts with the black hole. The transfer of energy during closest approach allows part of the cloud to become bound to the black hole, forming an eccentric disk that quickly fragments to form stars. Compressional heating due to the black hole raises the temperature of the gas up to several hundred to several thousand kelvin, ensuring that the fragmentation produces relatively high stellar masses. These stars retain the eccentricity of the disk and, for a sufficiently massive initial cloud, produce an extremely top-heavy distribution of stellar masses. This potentially repetitive process may explain the presence of multiple eccentric rings of young stars in the presence of a supermassive black hole.},

We first cool and load ∼10 6 neutral 88 Sr atoms into a magneto-optical trap from an oven that has no line of sight with the SET. The cold atoms are then pushed with a resonant laser into the trap region where they are subsequently photoionized and trapped in an SET operated at a cryogenic temperature of 4.6 K. We present studies of the loading process and show that our technique achieves ion loading into a shallow (15 meV depth) trap at rates as high as 125 ions/s while drastically reducing the amount of metal deposition on the trap surface as compared with direct loading from a hot vapor. Furthermore, we note that due to multiple stages of isotopic filtering in our loading process, this technique has the potential for enhanced isotopic selectivity over other loading methods. Rapid loading from a clean, isotopically pure, and precooled source may enable scalable quantum-information processing with trapped ions in large, low-depth surface-trap arrays that are not amenable to loading from a hot atomic beam.},

abstract = {<p>Research in the field of cold polar molecules is progressing rapidly. An array of interesting topics is being developed including precision measurement and fundamental tests, quantum phase transitions, and ultracold chemistry. In particular, dipolar molecules in well-defined quantum states enable exquisite control of their interactions via applied electric fields. The long-range, anisotropic interaction between dipolar molecules leads to new collision dynamics that could be used for novel collective effects, quantum state engineering, and information processing. The focus of this Thesis is the production of cold samples of neutral OH molecules via Stark deceleration and magnetic trapping for novel collision experiments. This novelty results from our combination of cold external beams and trapped target molecules which facilitates observation of dipolar effects as well as lowtemperature collision resonances. The large permanent electric dipole moment of OH allows us to precisely tune the lab-frame velocity of the molecular packets from $\sim$ 500 m/s to rest. We have magnetically trapped OH packets at the terminus of our Stark decelerator at a temperature of 70 mK and density of 106 cm-3. With improved understanding of Stark deceleration, we optimize the decelerator efficiency and its coupling to the magnetic trap. Our latest trap design uses permanent ring magnets to create a three-dimensional magnetic quadrupole field. Use of magnetically trapped OH molecules for collision experiments with external beams allow us the unique opportunity of observing both elastic and inelastic collisions. In addition, the trap confinement yields sensitivity to differential elastic cross sections at low collision energies. This open magnetic trap has allowed measurement of collision cross sections between trapped OH and external supersonic beams of He and D2, the latter of which is of astrophysical interest due to the role of H2-OH collisions in pumping interstellar OH megamasers. The combination of trapped OH molecules and temperaturetuned beams of He and D2 has facilitated measurement of the lowest-energy D2-OH collision cross iv sections yet reported. More recently, we report the first observation of electric-field dependent cross sections between two different species of cold polar molecules - OH and ND3 - thereby demonstrating control over molecular scattering in the cold regime. By combining for the first time the production techniques of Stark deceleration and buffer gas cooling, we increase the molecular interaction time by $\sim$ 105 over traditional crossed-beam experiments to gain enhanced sensitivity at the characteristic densities of cold molecule production.</p>\n},

The measurements are performed with nonpolar Rb$_2$ dimers which are prepared in precisely-defined quantum states and trapped in an array of quasi-1D potential tubes. We investigate collisions of molecules in the lowest triplet energy level where any inelastic process requires a relaxation to the singlet state. These are compared to two sets of collision experiments, carried out either with triplet molecules that have two quanta of rotational angular momentum or with vibrationally highly excited Feshbach molecules. We find no evidence for suppression of the inelastic collisions due to the necessary spin-flip, shedding light on this so far unsettled issue. For each of the molecular states studied here, we extract the decay rate constant and compare the results to theoretical predictions. Our investigations show a strong dependence of the decay rate constants on the confinement strength and the collision energy.

We find that modest fields of several thousand gauss can act to suppress inelastic collisions of weak-field seeking states by two orders of magnitude. We attribute this suppression to two factors: (i) An indirect coupling of the entrance and the exit channel, in contrast to the effect of an applied electric field; and (ii) the realtive motion of the entrance and exit scattering thresholds. In view of these results, magnetic trapping of OH may prove feasible.},

abstract = {Ultimately, the resolution of any spectroscopic experiment is limited by the interaction time between the particles that are to be examined and the measuring device. The obtainable spectroscopic resolution in a molecular beam experiment can be considerably improved using samples of slow molecules, as produced, for example, in a Stark-decelerator. This is demonstrated here by measuring the inversion tunneling spectrum of (ND3)-N-15 using a pulsed molecular beam that has been decelerated to about 52 m/s. Hyperfine resolved inversion transitions in (ND3)-N-15 in the J, K>=1, 1> state (around 1.43 GHz) are induced in a microwave region, and (ND3)-N-15 molecules that have undergone the transition are subsequently detected using a UV-laser based ionization detection scheme. To increase the signal intensity; the decelerated molecular beam is both transversally and longitudinally focused into the laser detection region. The observed spectral width of individual hyperfine transitions in the fully resolved spectrum is about 1 kHz; and the standard deviation of the best fit is 62 Hz.},

This behaviour manifests itself as rapid oscillatory structures in measured differential cross-sections, and such observable features are sensitive probes of molecular interaction potentials. However, these structures have proved challenging to resolve experimentally. Here, we use a Stark decelerator to form a beam of state-selected and velocity-controlled NO radicals and measure state-to-state differential cross-sections for inelastic collisions of NO with He, Ne and Ar atoms using velocity map imaging. The monochromatic velocity distribution of the NO beam produced scattering images with unprecedented sharpness and angular resolution, thereby fully resolving quantum diffraction oscillations. We found excellent agreement with quantum close-coupling scattering calculations for these benchmark systems.},

abstract = {We describe a generally applicable method for the experimental determination of stationary flow conditions in pulsed supersonic beams, utilizing time-resolved electron induced fluorescence measurements of high pressure jet expansions of helium. The detection of ultraviolet photons from electronically excited helium emitted very close to the nozzle exit images the valve opening behavior-with the decided advantage that a photon signal is not affected by beam-skimmer and beam-residual gas interactions; it thus allows to conclusively determine those operation parameters of a pulsed valve that yield complete opening. The studies reveal that a "flat-top" signal, indicating constant density and commonly considered as experimental criterion for continuous flow, is insufficient. Moreover, translational temperature and mean terminal flow velocity turn out to be significantly more sensitive in testing for the equivalent behavior of a continuous nozzle source. Based on the widely distributed Even-Lavie valve we demonstrate that, in principle, it is possible to achieve quasi-continuous flow conditions even with fast-acting valves; however, the two prerequisites are a minimum pulse duration that is much longer than standard practice and previous estimates, and a suitable tagging of the appropriate beam segment.},

abstract = {Various improvements are described for producing free jets and nozzle beams without complex formation. It is shown that our approach, based on the creation of a free-jet zone of silence unaffected by the background gas at relatively high pressure (PI N lo-' to 1 torr), is very efficient for improving the practical performance limited by the pumping means in the conventional method (PI 5 torr). The skimmer interference problem is found to be relatively simple at low ambient pressure but very difficult under our usual conditions where the free-jet shock wave structure is well formed. However, this difficulty is now conveniently solved and the zone of silence appears as an ideal medium for supercooling pure or seeded light gases expanded through miniature capillary nozzles (10-100 pm in diameter) operated at very high pressure (up to 200 bar) even at low temperature (down to 80 K). The limitations due to condensation, for most of the gases, are avoided by using high-temperature, high-pressure sources. Furthermore, skimming is greatly simplified by increasing the particle energy by heating and/or seeding, as also observed with clustering. The most interesting characteristics obtained for a He beam are as follows: speed ratios SI, N 350, corresponding to velocity spreads of OS%, energy resolutions of 0.6 meV, and translational temperatures Til N 6 X K. The kinetic energy range from lo-' to about 40 eV can be covered by the heating and seeding techniques. Results obtained for He-Ar and He-Xe mixtures in time-of-flight experiments are well confirmed theoretically by the method of moments of the Boltzmann equation. Finally, fluorescence measurements on heated CO free-jets find more or less complete rotational relaxation and vibrational freezing close to the nozzle throat, for instance at 2000 K with the source operated at 2500 K.},

Molecules travel through a spatially varying magnetic field and are repeatedly pumped into a weak-field seeking state as they move towards each strong field region, and into a strong-field seeking state as they move towards weak field. The method is time-independent and so is suitable for decelerating both pulsed and continuous molecular beams. By using guiding magnets at each weak field region, the beam can be simultaneously guided and decelerated. By tapering the magnetic field strength in the strong field regions, and exploiting the Doppler shift, the velocity distribution can be compressed during deceleration. We develop the principles of this deceleration technique, provide a realistic design, use numerical simulations to evaluate its performance for a beam of CaF, and compare this performance to other deceleration methods.},

abstract = {We propose and demonstrate a novel laser cooling mechanism applicable to particles with narrow-linewidth optical transitions. By sweeping the frequency of counter-propagating laser beams in a sawtooth manner, we cause adiabatic transfer back and forth between the ground state and a long-lived optically excited state. The time-ordering of these adiabatic transfers is determined by Doppler shifts, which ensures that the associated photon recoils are in the opposite direction to the particle's motion. This ultimately leads to a robust cooling mechanism capable of exerting large forces via a weak transition and with reduced reliance on spontaneous emission. We present a simple intuitive model for the resulting frictional force, and directly demonstrate its efficacy for increasing the total phase-space density of an atomic ensemble. We rely on both simulation and experimental studies using the 7.5$\sim$kHz linewidth $^1$S$_0$ to $^3$P$_1$ transition in $^{88}$Sr. The reduced reliance on spontaneous emission may allow this adiabatic sweep method to be a useful tool for cooling particles that lack closed cycling transitions, such as molecules.},

This paves the way towards molecular beam experiments wherein one beam is modified through interactions with, e.g. a laser beam or another molecular beam, while the other one remains unmodified and serves as a reference. Because both beams originate from the same parent beam, such differential experiments can dramatically enhance the sensitivity. The highly complex electrode structure required for the beam splitter would be very difficult to build by traditional means. Instead, we introduce a new method of production: 3D printing of a plastic piece, followed by electroplating. The 3D printed piece can take any desired shape and, since the entire structure can be printed as a single piece, provides inherently precise alignment. Electroplating produces atomically smooth metal surfaces that allow the application of electric potentials. The simple and powerful fabrication method introduced here opens a plethora of new avenues for research, far beyond molecular beams experiments, since 3D printing imposes practically no limitations on possible shapes, and the metal-plating produces chemically robust, conductive construction elements. It has the added advantage of dramatically reduced production cost and time: all components used in the present study were printed within less than 48 hours; electroplating is completed in one day, and the bottle neck of the entire process was the shipping to and from the plating company.},

abstract = {Electronic quenching of OH A (2)$\Sigma$(+) by Kr was investigated through experimental studies of the collision cross sections and the OH X (2)$\Pi$ product state distribution. The quenching cross sections decrease with increasing rotational excitation in the excited OH A (2)$\Sigma$(+) electronic state. The OH X (2)$\Pi$ products of quenching exhibit a significant degree of rotational excitation but minimal vibrational excitation. Complementary theoretical studies of the OH (A (2)$\Sigma$(+), X (2)$\Pi$) + Kr potential energy surfaces (PESs), nonadiabatic coupling, and quasiclassical trajectory calculations were carried out to elucidate the quenching dynamics. Accurate PESs for the two lowest diabatic states of A' symmetry were computed along with the angularly dependent coupling between them. Coupling in nearly linear HO-Kr configurations provides the mechanism for the observed electronic quenching. A deep attractive well on the OH A (2)$\Sigma$(+) + Kr PES facilitates access to this region of strong coupling. Surface-hopping quasiclassical trajectory calculations yielded quenching cross sections and a OH X (2)$\Pi$ product rotational distribution in good accord with experimental observations.},

abstract = {The realization of superfluidity in a dilute gas of fermionic atoms, analogous to superconductivity in metals, represents a long-standing goal of ultracold gas research. In such a fermionic superfluid, it should be possible to adjust the interaction strength and tune the system continuously between two limits: a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type superfluid (involving correlated atom pairs in momentum space) and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in which spatially local pairs of atoms are bound together. This crossover between BCS-type superfluidity and the BEC limit has long been of theoretical interest, motivated in part by the discovery of high-temperature superconductors. In atomic Fermi gas experiments superfluidity has not yet been demonstrated; however, long-lived molecules consisting of locally paired fermions have been reversibly created. Here we report the direct observation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate created solely by adjusting the interaction strength in an ultracold Fermi gas of atoms. This state of matter represents one extreme of the predicted BCS-BEC continuum.},

abstract = {While cold molecule experiments are rapidly moving towards their promised benefits of precision spectroscopy, controllable chemistry, and novel condensed phases, heretofore the field has been greatly limited by a lack of methods to cool and compress chemically diverse species to temperatures below ten millikelvin. While in atomic physics these needs are fulfilled by laser cooling, magneto-optical trapping, and evaporative cooling, until now none of these techniques have been applicable to molecules. In this thesis, two major breakthroughs are reported. The first is the observation of evaporative cooling in magnetically trapped hydroxyl (OH) radicals, which potentially opens a path all the way to Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar radicals, as well as allowing cold- and ultracold-chemistry studies of fundamental reaction mechanisms. Through the combination of an extremely high gradient magnetic quadrupole trap and the use of the OH $\Lambda$-doublet transition to enable highly selective forced evaporation, cooling by an order of magnitude in temperaturewas achieved and yielded a final temperature no higher than 5mK. The second breakthrough is the successful application of laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping to molecules. Motivated by a proposal in this thesis, laser cooling of molecules is now known to be technically feasible in a select but substantial pool of diatomic molecules. The demonstration of not only Doppler cooling but also two-dimensional magneto-optical trapping in yttrium (II) oxide, YO, is expected to enable rapid growth in the availability of ultracold molecules—just as the invention of the atomic magneto-optical trap stimulated atomic physics twenty-five years ago.},

@article{Richerme,
abstract = {The maximum speed with which information can propagate in a quan-tum many-body system directly affects how quickly disparate parts of the system can become correlated 1–4 and how difficult the system will be to describe numerically 5 . For systems with only short-range interactions, Lieb and Robinson derived a constant-velocity bound that limits corre-lations to within a linear effective 'light cone' 6 . However, little is known about the propagation speed in systems with long-range interactions, because analytic solutions rarely exist and because the best long-range bound 7 is too loose to accurately describe the relevant dynamical time-scales for any known spin model. Here we apply a variable-range Ising spin chain Hamiltonian and a variable-range XY spin chain Hamiltonian to a far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system and observe its time evolution. For several different interaction ranges, we determine the spatial and time-dependent correlations, extract the shape of the light cone and measure the velocity with which correlations propagate through the system. This work opens the possibility for studying a wide range of many-body dynamics in quantum systems that are otherwise intractable. Lieb–Robinson bounds 6 have strongly influenced our understanding of locally interacting, quantum many-body systems. They restrict the many-body dynamics to a well-defined causal region outside of which correlations are exponentially suppressed 8 , analogous to causal light cones that arise in relativistic theories. These bounds have enabled a number of important proofs in condensed-matter physics 5,7,9–11 , and also constrain the timescales on which quantum systems might thermalize 12–14 and the maximum speed that information can be sent through a quantum channel 15 . Recent experi-mental work has observed linear (that is, Lieb–Robinson-like) correlation growth over six sites in a one-dimensional quantum gas 16 . When interactions in a quantum system are long range, the speed with which correlations build up between distant particles is no longer guaranteed to obey the Lieb–Robinson prediction. Indeed, for sufficiently long-range interactions, the notion of locality is expected to break down completely 17 . Inapplicability of the Lieb–Robinson bound means that comparatively little can be predicted about the growth and propagation of correlations in long-range-interacting systems, although there have been several recent theoretical and numerical advances 2,3,7,17–20 . Here we report direct measurements of the shape of the causal region and the speed at which correlations propagate in an Ising spin chain and a newly implemented XY spin chain. The experiment is effectively deco-herence free and serves as an initial probe of the many-body dynamics of isolated quantum systems. Within this broad experimental framework, studies of entanglement growth 21},

abstract = {The surface of an insulator under vacuum and under electrical charge will flashover when illuminated by a critical dose of ultra-violet (UV) radiation - depending on the insulator size and material, insulator cone angle, the applied voltage and insulator shot-history. A testbed comprised of an excimer laser (KrF, 248 nm, -16 MW, 30 ns FWHM,), a vacuum chamber, and a negative polarity dc high voltage power supply (≤ -60 kV) were assembled to test 1.0 cm thick angled insulators for surfaceflashover. Several candidate insulator materials, e.g. High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), RexoliteR 1400, Macor™ and Mycalex, of varying cone angles were tested against UV illumination. Commercial energy meters were used to measure the UV fluence of the pulsed laser beam. Inhouse designed and fabricated capacitive probes (D-dots, >12 GHz bandwidth) were embedded in the anode electrode underneath the insulator to determine the time of UV arrival and time of flashover. Of the tested insulators, the +45 degree Rexolite insulator showed more resistance to UV for surface flashover; at UV fluence level of less than13 mJ/cm2, it was not possible to induce a flashover for up to -60 kV of DC potential across the insulator's surface. The probes also permitted the electrical charge on the insulator before and after flashover to be inferred. Photon to electron conversion efficiency for the surface of Rexolite insulator was determined from charge-balance equation. In order to understand the physical mechanism leading to flashover, we further experimented with the +45 degree Rexolite insulator by masking portions of the UV beam to illuminate only a section of the insulator surface; 1) the half nearest the cathode and subsequently, 2) the half nearest the anode. The critical UV fluence and time to flashover were measured and the results in each case were then compared with the base case of full-beam illumination. It was discovered that the time for the insulator to flash was earlier in time for the cathode-half beam illumination case than the anode-half illumination case which led us to believe that the flashover mechanism for the UV illumination is initiated from the cathode side of the insulator. Qualitatively stated, the testing revealed that the shielding of the cathode triple point against UV is more important than the anode triple junction in the design of vacuum insulators and electrodes.},

abstract = {Electrostatic hexapoles are common tools in physical chemistry for performing state-selection and focusing of molecules. A hexapole can be viewed as a 2D-trap for polar molecules in low-field seeking states. Therefore, by bending such a hexapole into a torus a storage ring for neutral molecules can be formed. We here review our experiments on such a prototype storage ring. The ring is loaded by a decelerated ammonia beam. The forward velocity as well as the longitudinal and transverse velocity spread of this beam can be adjusted prior to injection into the ring. Using a phase-space description it is detailed how loading of a molecular packet into the storage ring can be performed optimally. Various techniques are used to investigate the motion of the molecules in the ring. The stored molecules can be observed for up to 50 round trips, at which point the packet fills up the entire ring. A design is presented for a sectional storage ring in which the longitudinal spreading of the packet inside the ring can be controlled. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We study the BCS superfluid transition in a single-component fermionic gas of dipolar particles loaded in a tight bilayer trap, with the electric dipole moments polarized perpendicular to the layers. Based on the detailed analysis of the interlayer scattering, we calculate the critical temperature of the interlayer superfluid pairing transition when the layer separation is both smaller (dilute regime) and on the order or larger (dense regime) than the mean interparticle separation in each layer. Our calculations go beyond the standard BCS approach and include themany-body contributions resulting in the mass renormalization, as well as additional contributions to the pairing interaction.We find that the many-body effects have a pronounced effect on the critical temperature and can either decrease (in the very dilute limit) or increase (in the dense and moderately dilute limits) the transition temperature as compared to the BCS approach.},

The device, acting as an atomic low-pass velocity filter, utilizes permanent magnets to passively select the slow atoms present in a thermal atomic beam. Slow atoms are guided along a curved, conduction-limited tube by an octupole magnetic field, while fast atoms, unable to follow the curved trajectory, strike the tube wall and are removed from the beam. The performance of the device is demonstrated by loading a magneto-optical trap. Approximately 2×108 lithium atoms are loaded with a rate of ∼6×106 atoms/s, while maintaining a background gas pressure of ∼10-11 torr.

Much of the work in ultracold matter has focused on systems of alkali or alkaline-earth atoms, mainly due to their ease of cooling. Extending this precise control to molecules has seen rapidly increasing interest and activity, as molecules possess additional degrees of freedom that make them useful for tests of fundamental physics, studying ultracold chemistry and collisions, and engineering qualitatively new types of quantum phases and quantum many-body systems. Here, we review one particularly fruitful research direction: the creation and manipulation of ultracold bialkali molecules.

abstract = {Cooling of molecules via free-space dissipative scattering of photons is thought not to be practicable due to the inherently large number of Raman loss channels available to molecules and the prohibitive expense of building multiple repumping laser systems. The use of an optical cavity to enhance coherent Rayleigh scattering into a decaying cavity mode has been suggested as a potential method to mitigate Raman loss, thereby enabling the laser cooling of molecules to ultracold temperatures. We discuss the possibility of cavity-assisted laser cooling particles without closed transitions, identify conditions necessary to achieve efficient cooling, and suggest solutions given experimental constraints. Specifically, it is shown that cooperativities much greater than unity are required for cooling without loss, and that this could be achieved via the superradiant scattering associated with intracavity self-localization of the molecules. Particular emphasis is given to the polar hydroxyl radical (OH), cold samples of which are readily obtained from Stark deceleration.},

The Zeeman decelerator features a modular design that is mechanically easy to extend to arbitrary length, and allows for solenoid and hexapole elements that are convenient to replace. The solenoids and associated electronics are efficiently water cooled and allow the Zeeman decelerator to operate at repetition rates exceeding 10 Hz. We characterize the performance of the decelerator using various beams of metastable rare gas atoms.

At helium temperatures the conductance between all the types of surfaces examined is proportional to T 2, but the temperature dependence is small at nitrogen temperatures. For metal contacts the electrical conductance is extremely sensitive to the previous history of the surfaces, but the heat conductance is little dependent on this. The thermal conductance is always much greater than corresponds to the electrical conductance according to the Wiedemann‐Franz‐Lorenz law and this fact, together with the differing behavior of the two conductances under changing loads, suggests that nearly all the heat flow takes place through electrically nonconducting parts of the surface.

abstract = {Anisotropy is a fundamental property of particle interactions. It occupies a central role in cold and ultra-cold molecular processes, where long range forces have been found to significantly depend on orientation in ultra-cold polar molecule collisions. Recent experiments have demonstrated the emergence of quantum phenomena such as scattering resonances in the cold collisions regime due to quantization of the intermolecular degrees of freedom. Although these states have been shown to be sensitive to interaction details, the effect of anisotropy on quantum resonances has eluded experimental observation so far. Here, we directly measure the anisotropy in atom-molecule interactions via quantum resonances by changing the quantum state of the internal molecular rotor. We observe that a quantum scattering resonance at a collision energy of $k_B$ x 270 mK appears in the Penning ionization of molecular hydrogen with metastable helium only if the molecule is rotationally excited. We use state of the art ab initio and multichannel quantum molecular dynamics calculations to show that the anisotropy contributes to the effective interaction only for $H_2$ molecules in the first excited rotational state, whereas rotationally ground state $H_2$ interacts purely isotropically with metastable helium. Control over the quantum state of the internal molecular rotation allows us to switch the anisotropy on or off and thus disentangle the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the interaction. These quantum phenomena provide a challenging benchmark for even the most advanced theoretical descriptions, highlighting the advantage of using cold collisions to advance the microscopic understanding of particle interactions.},

Combining for the first time the techniques of Stark deceleration, magnetic trapping, and cryogenic buffer gas cooling allows the enhancement of molecular interaction time by 10$^5$. This has enabled an absolute measurement of the total trap loss cross sections between OH and ND$_3$ at a mean collision energy of 3.6 cm$^{-1}$ (5 K). Due to the dipolar interaction, the total cross section increases upon application of an external polarizing electric field. Cross sections computed from \emph{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are in excellent agreement with the measured value at zero external electric field. The theory presented here represents the first such analysis of collisions between a $^2\Pi$ radical and a closed-shell polyatomic molecule.},

abstract = {Recent advances1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling of atoms to nanokelvin temperatures have opened important areas of research, such as BoseEinstein condensation and ultracold atomic collisions. Similarly, the ability to trap and cool molecules should facilitate the study of ultracold molecular physics and collisions6; improvements in molecular spectroscopy could be anticipated. Also, ultracold molecules could aid the search for electric dipole moments of elementary particles7. But although laser cooling (in the case of alkali metals1,8,9) and cryogenic surface thermalization (in the case of hydrogen10,11) are currently used to cool some atoms sufficiently to permit their loading into magnetic traps, such techniques are not applicable to molecules, because of the latter's complex internal energy-level structure. (Indeed, most atoms have resisted trapping by these techniques.) We have reported a more general loading technique12 based on elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas, and have used it to trap atomic chromium and europium13,14. Here we apply this technique to magnetically trap a molecular speciescalcium monohydride (CaH). We use Zeeman spectroscopy to determine the number of trapped molecules and their temperature, and set upper bounds on the cross-sectional areas of collisional relaxation processes. The technique should be applicable to many paramagnetic molecules and atoms.},

Interpretation of these studies has been limited by lack of control over the quantum states of the incoming collision partners. We report here the rotationally inelastic collisions of quantum-state prepared deuterium hydride (HD) with H2 and D2 using a method that provides an improved control over the input states. HD was coexpanded with its partner in a single supersonic beam, which reduced the collision temperature to 0–5 K, and thereby restricted the involved incoming partial waves to s and p. By preparing HD with its bond axis preferentially aligned parallel and perpendicular to the relative velocity of the colliding partners, we observed that the rotational relaxation of HD depends strongly on the initial bond-axis orientation. We developed a partial-wave analysis that conclusively demonstrates that the scattering mechanism involves the exchange of internal angular momentum between the colliding partners. The striking differences between H2/HD and D2/HD scattering suggest the presence of anisotropically sensitive resonances.},

Cat states are equal superpositions of two maximally different quantum states. They are a fundamental resource in fault-tolerant quantum computing and quantum communication, where they can enable protocols such as open-destination teleportation and secret sharing. They play a role in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and enable improved signal-to-noise ratios in interferometry. Cat states are very sensitive to decoherence, and as a result their preparation is challenging and can serve as a demonstration of good quantum control. Here we report the creation of cat states of up to six atomic qubits. Each qubit's state space is defined by two hyperfine ground states of a beryllium ion; the cat state corresponds to an entangled equal superposition of all the atoms in one hyperfine state and all atoms in the other hyperfine state. In our experiments, the cat states are prepared in a three-step process, irrespective of the number of entangled atoms. Together with entangled states of a different class created in Innsbruck, this work represents the current state-of-the-art for large entangled states in any qubit system.},

abstract = {Recently, we developed a method for calculating the lifetime of a particle inside a magnetic trap with respect to spin flips, as a first step in our efforts to understand the quantum-mechanics of magnetic traps. The 1D toy model that was used in this study was physically unrealistic because the magnetic field was not curl-free. Here, we study, both classically and quantum-mechanically, the problem of a neutral particle with spin S, mass m and magnetic moment mu, moving in 3D in an inhomogeneous magnetic field corresponding to traps of the Ioffe-Pritchard, `clover-leaf' and `baseball' type. Defining by omegap, omegaz and omegar the precessional, the axial and the lateral vibrational frequencies, respectively, of the particle in the adiabatic potential, we find classically the region in the (omegar% (omegar - omegaz) plane where the particle is trapped. Quantum-mechanically, we study the problem of a spin-one particle in the same field. Treating omegar omegap and omegaz omegap as small parameters for the perturbation from the adiabatic Hamiltonian, we derive a closed-form expression for the transition rate 1/Tesc of the particle from its trapped ground-state. We find that in the extreme cases, the expression for 1/Tesc is dominated by the largest of the two frequencies omegar and omegaz.},

abstract = {A unique property of Zeeman effect based manipulation of paramagnetic particle's motion is the ability to control velocities of both atoms and molecules. In particular the moving magnetic trap decelerator is capable of slowing and eventually trapping mixtures of both cold atoms and cold molecules generated in a supersonic expansion. Here we report the deceleration of molecular oxygen together with metastable argon atoms. The cold mixture with temperature below 1 K is slowed from an initial velocity of 430 m s −1 down to 100 m s −1 . Our decelerator spans 2.4 m and consists of 480 quadrupole traps. Our results pave the way for the study of sympathetic cooling of molecules by laser cooled atoms. The production of cold and ultracold molecules is a growing field fueled by many possible applications in different disciplines such as cold chemistry, precision spectroscopy and degenerate quantum gas research. The internal molecular degrees of freedom such as rotation or vibration, which are absent in atoms, offer many opportunities. However, they also introduce complexity, presenting new experimental challenges, such that novel methods need to be developed to gain access and control over the additional degrees of freedom. Despite the growing effort, production of ultracold molecular ensembles is still a formidable experimental challenge with no proven and general methods for cooling and trapping. Laser-cooling, while largely successful and straightforward for particular atoms, can only be applied to a small set of molecules with favorable vibrational transitions [1–3]. Several alternative approaches for producing cold molecules are currently being pursued in various labs around the world. The indirect strategy uses laser-cooled alkali-metal atoms, which are assembled into ultra-cold molecules via photo-association [4] and magneto-association[5, 6]. Utilizing the well established techniques from the field of cold atoms, few bi-alkali molecules have been produced at ultra cold temperatures and even close to the quantum degeneracy limit [7]. Direct approaches include buffer gas cooling, where molecules are cooled by collisions with helium atoms in cryogenic environment [8]. The obtained temperatures are typically in the range of 0.5–4 K where even lower temperatures can be reached by applying velocity filtering [9]. Using these techniques a large variety of atomic and molecular species have been cooled and few paramagnetic molecular species have been trapped in deep magnetic traps generated by superconducting coils [10]. Finally the efficient cooling of both internal and translational degrees of freedom taking place during adiabatic expansion of supersonic beams can be combined with a variety of methods that allow for the manipulation of the beam mean velocity. The benefits of supersonic beams as a source of cold atoms or molecules have been already realized half a century ago. Here, the high flux of atoms and small molecules can be produced with all the degrees of freedom cooled to about 1 K but translationally accelerated in the forward direction to velocities of several hundreds to thousands of meters per second. Supersonic beams are produced by the adiabatic expansion of a high pressure gas through a small aperture into vacuum. In addition to the carrier gas, which is typically a noble gas such as He, Ne, Ar or Kr, many other atoms and molecules can be entrained or seeded into the beam by means of laser ablation or passing the beam through a vapor cell. For some applications, such as merged beams cold-collision experiments [11], the high beam velocity in the lab frame of reference does not impose a fundamental limit. However, in order to approach quantum degeneracy it is necessary to apply additional phase space compression OPEN ACCESS},

abstract = {Laser cooling and trapping are central to modern atomic physics. The workhorse technique in cold-atom physics is the magneto-optical trap (MOT), which combines laser cooling with a restoring force from radiation pressure. For a variety of atomic species, MOTs can capture and cool large numbers of particles to ultracold temperatures (<1 mK); this has enabled the study of a wide range of phenomena from optical clocks to ultracold collisions whilst also serving as the ubiquitous starting point for further cooling into the regime of quantum degeneracy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules could provide a similarly powerful starting point for the study and manipulation of ultracold molecular gases. Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule, strontium monofluoride (SrF), at a temperature of approximately 2.5 mK. This method is expected to be viable for a significant number of diatomic species. Such chemical diversity is desired for the wide array of existing and proposed experiments which employ molecules for applications ranging from precision measurement, to quantum simulation and quantum information, to ultracold chemistry.},

abstract = {The {KATRIN} neutrino experiment operates about 20 turbo-molecular pumps (TMP) in the vicinity of super-conducting magnets, pumping out tritium gas from the electron beam-line of the experiment. In a dedicated test setup with Helmholtz coils systematic studies have been conducted, investigating the rotor temperature and stability of operation of {TMPs} at full speed as a function of gas load, magnetic field strength and direction of the field. The temperature of the magnetically levitated spinning rotor was measured in vacuum with an infra-red pyrometer. A simple model has been developed, which describes quantitatively the temporal progression of the rotor temperature as a function of gas flow and field strength of an external static magnetic field. The model requires 5 pump-specific parameters, characterising the heating effects of eddy currents and gas friction and cooling by radiation loss and convection. When designing a vacuum system with {TMPs} in a critical environment (e.g. magnetic beam-line, fusion reactor), the model can be used to predict the maximum temperature of the rotor, to ensure a safe operation of the pump. },

abstract = {In nonrelativistic quantum theories with short-range Hamiltonians, a velocity v can be chosen such that the influence of any local perturbation is approximately confined to within a distance r until a time t ∼ r=v, thereby defining a linear light cone and giving rise to an emergent notion of locality. In systems with power-law (1=r $\alpha$) interactions, when $\alpha$ exceeds the dimension D, an analogous bound confines influences to within a distance r only until a time t ∼ ð$\alpha$=vÞ log r, suggesting that the velocity, as calculated from the slope of the light cone, may grow exponentially in time. We rule out this possibility; light cones of power-law interacting systems are bounded by a polynomial for $\alpha$ > 2D and become linear as $\alpha$ → ∞. Our results impose strong new constraints on the growth of correlations and the production of entangled states in a variety of rapidly emerging, long-range interacting atomic, molecular, and optical systems.},

@article{Yan2013,
abstract = {In this paper, we report on the design and performance of a new home-built pulsed gas valve, which we refer to as the Nijmegen Pulsed Valve (NPV). The main output characteristics include a short pulse width (as short as 20 $\mu$s) combined with operating rates up to 30 Hz. The operation principle of the NPV is based on the Lorentz force created by a pulsed current passing through an aluminum strip located within a magnetic field, which opens the nozzle periodically. The amplitude of displacement of the opening mechanism is sufficient to allow the use of nozzles with up to 1.0 mm diameter. To investigate the performance of the valve, several characterizations were performed with different experimental methods. First, a fast ionization gauge was used to measure the beam intensity of the free jet emanating from the NPV. We compare free jets from the NPV with those from several other pulsed valves in current use in our laboratory. Results showed that a high intensity and short pulse-length beam could be generated by the new valve. Second, the NPV was tested in combination with a skimmer, where resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization combined with velocity map imaging was used to show that the NPV was able to produce a pulsed molecular beam with short pulse duration ($\sim$20 $\mu$s using 0.1% NO/He at 6 bars) and low rotational temperature ($\sim$1 K using 0.5% NO/Ar at 6 bars). Third, a novel two-point pump-probe method was employed which we label double delay scan. This method allows a full kinematic characterization of the molecular beam, including accurate speed ratios at different temporal positions. It was found that the speed ratio was maximum (S = 50 using 0.1% NO/He at 3 bars) at the peak position of the molecular beam and decreased when it was on the leading or falling edge.},

We show that apart from the stability provided by the mechanical rotation of the nanomagnet (as in the classical Levitron), the quantum spin origin of its magnetization provides two additional mechanisms to stably levitate the system. Despite of the Earnshaw theorem, such stable phases are present even in the absence of mechanical rotation. For large magnetic fields, the Larmor precession of the quantum magnetic moment stabilizes the system in full analogy with magnetic trapping of a neutral atom. For low magnetic fields, the magnetic anisotropy stabilizes the system via the Einstein-de Haas effect. These results are obtained with a linear stability analysis of a single magnetic domain rigid nanosphere with uniaxial anisotropy in a Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic field.},

abstract = {The concept of phase stability in a Stark decelerator ensures that polar molecules can be accelerated, guided, or decelerated without loss; molecules within a certain position and velocity interval are kept together throughout the deceleration process. In this paper the influence of the transverse motion on phase stability in a Stark decelerator is investigated. For typical deceleration experiments—i.e., for high values of the phase angle ϕ0—the transverse motion considerably enhances the region in phase space for which phase stable deceleration occurs. For low values of ϕ0, however, the transverse motion reduces the acceptance of a Stark decelerator and unstable regions in phase space appear. These effects are quantitatively explained in terms of a coupling between the longitudinal and transverse motion. The predicted longitudinal acceptance of a Stark decelerator is verified by measurements on a beam of OH (X 2$\Pi$3∕2,J=3∕2) radicals passing through a Stark decelerator.},

abstract = {The Raman depolarization ratios for individual Q1(J”) branch lines of all diatomic hydrogen isotopologues – H2, HD, D2, HT, DT, and T2 – were measured, for all rotational levels with population larger than 1/100 relative to the Boltzmann maximum at room temperature. For these measurements, the experimental setup normally used for the monitoring of the tritiated hydrogen molecules at KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino experiment was adapted to optimally control the excitation laser power and polarization, and to precisely define the Raman light collection geometry. The measured Raman depolarization values were compared to theoretical values, which are linked to polarizability tensor quantities. For this, the ‘raw data' were corrected taking into account distinct aspects affecting Raman depolarization data, including (1) excitation polarization impurities; (2) extended Raman excitation volumes; and (3) Raman light collection over finite solid angles. Our corrected depolarization ratios of the hydrogen isotopologues agree with the theoretical values (based on ab initio quantum calculations by R.J. LeRoy, University of Waterloo, Canada) to better than 5% for nearly all of the measured Q1(J”) lines, with 1$\sigma$ confidence level. The results demonstrate that reliable, accurate Raman depolarization ratios can be extracted from experimental measurements, which may be substantially distorted by excitation polarization impurities and by geometrical effects.

abstract = {The centre-line intensity I(0)(s-1sr-1) of a supersonic beam source is fully described by the peaking factor $\kappa$=$\pi$(I(0)/N), with N (s-1) the flow rate. For a skimmerless source in a cryoexpansion chamber we find $\kappa$ = 2.07, 1.48, 1.47, 1.20 and 1.17 for Ar, O2, N2, CO2 and CH4, respectively. These results are in fair agreement with numerical solutions of the flow field downstream of the sonic plane. The shielding effect of the skimmer is conveniently described by mapping the perpendicular distribution, which cools geometrically, into a constant virtual source distribution in the nozzle plane. We use a bimodal distribution to analyze the beam profile measurements. For Ar and Kr the radius R1 of the narrow virtual source is given by R1/zref=4.4($\Xi$/100)0.28 with zref=0.802Rn, Rn being the nozzle radius, $\Xi$=3.189(($\gamma$-1)/$\gamma$) 1 2n0zref(C6/kT0) 1 3the source parameter, n0 and T0 the number density and the temperature of the reservoir, respectively. These results are in good agreement with a "last collision surface" extension of the thermal conduction model by Habets. For O2 and N2 we find R1/zref=10.1($\Xi$/100)0.42 with zref= 0.598Rn. By scaling the "last collision surface" from the Ar and Kr data for the case of diatomics we find fair agreement with a modified thermal conduction model by Klots.

In particular, samples of ground-state molecules at ultralow temperatures and high number densities will allow novel quantum-gas studies and future applications in quantum information science. However, high phase-space densities for molecular samples are not readily attainable as efficient cooling techniques such as laser cooling are lacking. Here we produce an ultracold and dense sample of molecules in a single hyperfine level of the rovibronic ground state with each molecule individually trapped in the motional ground state of an optical lattice well. Starting from a zero-temperature atomic Mott-insulator state with optimized double-site occupancy, weakly-bound dimer molecules are efficiently associated on a Feshbach resonance and subsequently transferred to the rovibronic ground state by a stimulated four-photon process with >50 % efficiency. The molecules are trapped in the lattice and have a lifetime of 8 s. Our results present a crucial step towards Bose-Einstein condensation of ground-state molecules and, when suitably generalized to polar heteronuclear molecules, the realization of dipolar quantum-gas phases in optical lattices.},

abstract = {The standard model of particle physics accurately describes all particle physics measurements made so far in the laboratory. However, it is unable to answer many questions that arise from cosmological observations, such as the nature of dark matter and why matter dominates over antimatter throughout the Universe. Theories that contain particles and interactions beyond the standard model, such as models that incorporate supersymmetry, may explain these phenomena. Such particles appear in the vacuum and interact with common particles to modify their properties. For example, the existence of very massive particles whose interactions violate time-reversal symmetry, which could explain the cosmological matter–antimatter asymmetry, can give rise to an electric dipole moment along the spin axis of the electron. No electric dipole moments of fundamental particles have been observed. However, dipole moments only slightly smaller than the current experimental bounds have been predicted to arise from particles more massive than any known to exist. Here we present an improved experimental limit on the electric dipole moment of the electron, obtained by measuring the electron spin precession in a superposition of quantum states of electrons subjected to a huge intramolecular electric field. The sensitivity of our measurement is more than one order of magnitude better than any previous measurement. This result implies that a broad class of conjectured particles, if they exist and time-reversal symmetry is maximally violated, have masses that greatly exceed what can be measured directly at the Large Hadron Collider.},

In the traveling wave decelerator, a moving potential is created by a series of ring-shaped electrodes to which oscillating high voltages (HV) are applied. By lowering the frequency of the applied voltages, the molecules confined in the moving trap are decelerated and brought to a standstill. As the molecules are confined in a true 3D well, this kind of deceleration has practically no losses, resulting in a great improvement on the usual Stark deceleration techniques. The necessary voltages are generated by amplifying the output of an arbitrary wave generator using fast HV amplifiers, giving us great control over the trapped molecules. We illustrate this by experiments in which we adiabatically cool trapped NH3 and ND3 molecules and resonantly excite their motion.},

Here, we report strong quantum correlations between photons on picosecond timescales. We observe (a) photon antibunching upon resonant excitation of the lowest-energy polariton state, proving that the first cavity photon blocks the subsequent injection events, and (b) photon bunching when the laser field is in two-photon resonance with the polariton eigenstates of the second Jaynes-Cummings manifold, demonstrating that two photons at this color are more likely to be injected into the cavity jointly, than they would otherwise.

Thermal conduction across significant temperature differences should be calculated using thermal conductivity integrals. Note that the thermal conductivity and the thermal conductivity integral of a material can depend strongly on composition and fabrication history. Without verification, the data in the accompanying figures should be used only for qualitative heat flow calculations. Calculating the heat conduction through a body with its ends at greatly different temperatures is made difficult by the strong temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity between absolute zero and room temperature. The use of thermal conductivity integrals (called thermal boundary potentials by Garwin) allows the heat flow to be calculated as where $\Theta$ is the integral of the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, K, calculated as and G is a geometry factor calculated as where A(x) is the cross sectional area at position x along the path of heat flow.

Based on the collision rates we discuss the prospects for evaporative cooling of electrostatically trapped OH. We also find that the scattering properties at ultralow temperatures prove to be remarkably independent of the details of the short-range interaction, owing to avoided crossings in the long-range adiabatic potential curves. The behavior of the scattering rate constants is qualitatively understood in terms of a novel set of long-range states of the [OH]$_2$ dimer.},

These electrons then usually multiply as they traverse the insulator surface, either as a surface secondary electron emission avalanche, or as an electron cascade in a thin surface layer, causing desorption of gas which had been adsorbed on the insulator surface. This des-orbed gas is then ionized, which leads to surface flashover of the insulator.

However, the types of molecules that have been laser-cooled so far do not have the highly desirable combination of features for new physics searches, such as the ability to fully polarize and the existence of internal co-magnetometer states.

abstract = {Momentum correlations in a one-dimensional equilibrium ensemble of trapped fermions, with a point inter- action between particles of opposite spin have been studied. In the degenerate regime correlations were observed between fermions with opposite spins and momenta, similar to Cooper pairing. These correlations appear as soon as the temperature is below the Fermi energy, which is a much less stringent condition than that of the BCS transition proper. Calculations are carried out in both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. To achieve the latter, it is shown that interacting fermionic dynamics may be solved as a stochastic linear trans- formation of Grassmann algebra generators, much in the way random c-number paths are introduced in the conventional quantum stochastics of bosons. Importantly, the method thus emerging is inherently free of the sign problem.},

abstract = {The hydroxyl radical (OH) is the primary oxidant in the atmosphere, responsible for many photochemical reactions that affect both regional air quality and global climate change. Because of its high reactivity, abundances of OH in the troposphere are less than 1 part per trillion by volume (pptv) and thus difficult to measure accurately. This paper describes an instrument for the sensitive detection of OH in the troposphere using low-pressure laser-induced fluorescence. Ambient air is expanded into a low pressure detection chamber, and OH is both excited and detected using the A(sup 2) Epsilon(+)(v prime = 0) yields X(sup 2)Pi(v double prime = 0) transition near 308 nm. An injector upstream of the detection axis allows for the addition of reagent NO to convert ambient HO2 to OH using the fast reaction HO2 + NO yields OH + NO2. Using recent advances in laser and detector technologies, this prototype instrument is able to detect less than 1 x 10(exp 5) molecules/cu cm (0.004 pptv) of OH with an integration time of 30 s with negligible interferences.},

abstract = {We consider quantized motion of neutral atoms cooled below the recoil limit in a quadrupole magnetostatic trap. Because of Majorana transitions to untrapped levels near the point of zero field at the trap center, all quantum levels have a nonzero decay rate. The Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation associated with the potential g$\mu$B {\textperiodcentered} S (S is the total atomic spin) takes the form of coupled equations in r when the spinor components are expanded in spherical harmonics. We integrate the multichannel problem numerically to obtain asymptotic phase shifts, resonance energies, and widths. For S = 1/2, the lowest levels have widths somewhat less than their spacing. Thus the trap quantum-level structure might possibly be observable if the atoms are sufficiently cold, namely, in the 0.1-$\mu$K regime for most atoms and attainable trap field gradients. The width decreases rapidly with increasing MJ, the angular momentum about the symmetry axis. Spectroscopic linewidths of a few hertz are possible if there is enough population in the lowest levels with a few MJ quanta. The decay rate of the lowest levels, however, is probably too rapid for studying Bose–Einstein condensation in such a trap.},

Given this ubiquity, there is a worldwide effort to improve the efficiency and resolution of mass spectrometers. However, the performance of all techniques is ultimately limited by the initial phase-space distribution of the molecules being analyzed. Here, we dramatically reduce the width of this initial phase-space distribution by sympathetically cooling the input molecules with laser-cooled, co-trapped atomic ions, improving both the mass resolution and detection efficiency of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer by over an order of magnitude. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations verify the technique and aid with evaluating its effectiveness. Our technique appears to be applicable to other types of mass spectrometers.},

abstract = {Ultracold molecules represent a fascinating research frontier in physics and chemistry, but it has proven challenging to prepare dense samples at low velocities. Here we present a solution to this goal by a non- conventional approach dubbed cryofuge. It employs centrifugal force to bring cryogenically cooled molecules to kinetic energies below 1 K × kB in the laboratory frame, with corresponding fluxes exceeding 10^10/s at velocities below 20 m/s. By attaining densities higher than 10^9/cm3 and interaction times longer than 25 ms in samples of fluoromethane as well as deuterated ammonia, we observe cold dipolar collisions between molecules and determine their collision cross sections.},

We measure the binding energy of the RbCs molecule to be hc×3811.576(1)cm-1 and the |v′′=0,J′′=0| to |v′′=0,J′′=2| splitting to be h×2940.09(6)MHz. Stark spectroscopy of the rovibrational ground state yields an electric dipole moment of 1.225(3)(8) D, where the values in parentheses are the statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively. We can access a space-fixed dipole moment of 0.355(2)(4) D, which is substantially higher than in previous work.},

The phase space is a mixture of regular and chaotic orbits, the latter becoming dominant as the energy of the atoms increases. The trapping capabilities of these perpendicular Gaussian beams are investigated by considering an atomic ensemble in free motion. After a sudden turn on of the dipole trap, a certain fraction of atoms in the ensemble remains trapped. The majority of these trapped atoms has energies larger than the escape channels, which can be explained by the existence of regular and chaotic orbits with very long escape times.},

abstract = {We report absolute optical frequencies of electronic transitions from the $X\, ^2\Pi_{3/2},v''=0,J''=3/2$ rovibronic ground state to the 12 lowest levels of the $A\, ^2\Sigma^+,v'=0$ vibronic state in $^{16}$OH, as well as to the 16 lowest levels of the same vibronic state in $^{16}$OD. The absolute frequencies of these transitions have been determined with a relative uncertainty of a few parts in $10^{11}$, representing a $\sim$1000-fold improvement over previous measurements. To reach this level of precision, an optical frequency comb has been used to transfer the stability of a narrow-linewidth I$_2$-stabilized reference laser onto the 308-nm spectroscopy laser. The comb is also used to compare the optical frequency of the spectroscopy laser to an atomic clock reference, providing absolute accuracy. Measurements have been carried out on OH/OD molecules in a highly-collimated molecular beam, reducing possible pressure shifts and minimizing Doppler broadening. Systematic shifts due to retroreflection quality, the Zeeman effect, and the ac Stark effect have been considered during the analysis of the measured spectra; particularly in the case of the OD isotopologue, these effects can result in shifts of the fitted line positions of as much as 300 kHz. The transition frequencies extracted in the analysis were also used to determine spectroscopic constants for the $A\, ^2\Sigma^+,v'=0$ vibronic state. The constants fitted in this work differ significantly from those reported in previous works that measured the $A - X$ transitions, resulting in typical deviations of the predicted optical transition frequencies of $\sim$150 MHz, but they generally agree quite well with the constants determined using hyperfine-resolved measurements of splittings within the $A$ state.},

The translational temperature of the trapped CH3 radicals was about 200 mK. The methyl radical is a non-polar polyatomic molecule, which is predicted to be an ideal system for further cooling below 1 mK via sympathetic cooling with ultracold atoms. In addition, it is a highly reactive intermediate that plays an important role in various processes in cold environments such as planetary atmospheres and the interstellar medium. The demonstrated trapping capability of methyl radicals opens up various possibilities for realizing ultracold ensembles of molecules towards Bose-Einstein condensation of polyatomic molecules and investigations of reactions governed by quantum statistics.},

The study of reactions in the ultracold regime is a new research frontier enabled by cooling and trapping techniques developed in atomic and molecular physics. In addition, ultracold molecular gases that offer diverse molecular internal states and large electric dipolar interactions are sought after for studies of strongly interacting many-body quantum physics. Here we propose a new approach for producing ultracold molecules in the absolute internal and motional quantum ground state, where single molecules are assembled one by one from individual atoms. The scheme involves laser cooling, optical trapping, Raman sideband cooling, and coherent molecular state transfer. As a crucial initial step, we demonstrate quantum control of constituent atoms, including 3D ground-state cooling of a single Cs atom, in a simple apparatus. As laser technology advances to shorter wavelengths, additional atoms will be amenable to laser-cooling, allowing more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules to be assembled with full quantum control.},

abstract = {We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the rotationally inelastic scattering of OH ($X\,^2\Pi_{3/2}, J=3/2, f$) radicals with the collision partners He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and D$_2$ as a function of the collision energy between $\sim 70$ cm$^{-1}$ and 400$\sim$cm$^{-1}$. The OH radicals are state selected and velocity tuned prior to the collision using a Stark decelerator, and field-free parity-resolved state-to-state inelastic relative scattering cross sections are measured in a crossed molecular beam configuration. For all OH-rare gas atom systems excellent agreement is obtained with the cross sections predicted by close-coupling scattering calculations based on accurate \emph{ab initio} potential energy surfaces. This series of experiments complements recent studies on the scattering of OH radicals with Xe [Gilijamse \emph{et al.}, Science {\bf 313}, 1617 (2006)], Ar [Scharfenberg \emph{et al.}, Phys. Chem.

abstract = {A microstructured array of 1254 electrodes on a substrate has been configured to generate an array of local minima of electric field strength with a periodicity of 120 $\mu$m about 25 $\mu$m above the substrate. By applying sinusoidally varying potentials to the electrodes, these minima can be made to move smoothly along the array. Polar molecules in low-field seeking quantum states can be trapped in these traveling potential wells. Recently, we experimentally demonstrated this by transporting metastable CO molecules at constant velocities above the substrate [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 (2008) 153003]. Here, we outline and experimentally demonstrate how this microstructured array can be used to decelerate polar molecules directly from a molecular beam. For this, the sinusoidally varying potentials need to be switched on when the molecules arrive above the chip, their frequency needs to be chirped down in time, and they need to be switched off before the molecules leave the chip again. Deceleration of metastable CO molecules from an initial velocity of 360 m/s to a final velocity as low as 240 m/s is demonstrated in the 15-35 mK deep potential wells above the 5 cm long array of electrodes. This corresponds to a deceleration of almost $10^5$ $g$, and about 85 cm$^{-1}$ of kinetic energy is removed from the metastable CO molecules in this process.},

abstract = {Cryogenically cooled buffer gas beam sources of the molecule thorium monoxide (ThO) are optimized and characterized. Both helium and neon buffer gas sources are shown to produce ThO beams with high flux, low divergence, low forward velocity, and cold internal temperature for a variety of stagnation densities and nozzle diameters. The beam operates with a buffer gas stagnation density of $\sim$10^15-10^16 cm^-3 (Reynolds number $\sim$1-100), resulting in expansion cooling of the internal temperature of the ThO to as low as 2 K. For the neon (helium) based source, this represents cooling by a factor of about 10 (2) from the initial nozzle temperature of about 20 K (4 K). These sources deliver $\sim$10^11 ThO molecules in a single quantum state within a 1-3 ms long pulse at 10 Hz repetition rate. Under conditions optimized for a future precision spectroscopy application [A C Vutha et al 2010 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 43 074007], the neon-based beam has the following characteristics: forward velocity of 170 m/s, internal temperature of 3.4 K, and brightness of 3x10^11 ground state molecules per steradian per pulse. Compared to typical supersonic sources, the relatively low stagnation density of this source, and the fact that the cooling mechanism relies only on collisions with an inert buffer gas, make it widely applicable to many atomic and molecular species, including those which are chemically reactive, such as ThO.},

The conductance and transmission probability for short tubes is discussed in relation to Clausing type integral equations and their approximate solutions. A review is given of theoretical and experimental investigations of molecular gas flow emission patterns for tubes and components. An estimation for the effective transmission probability and conductance of more complex systems, particularly of tubes, diaphragms, baffles etc connected in series, is considered as well as their experimental determination using scale models and statistical Monte Carlo type methods for their more accurate calculation. The definition of pumping speed and the development of different procedures which have been adopted in recent years for its measurement under molecular flow conditions are reviewed. It has been shown that the difficulty in the various methods was associated with the determination of the pressure at the mouth of the pump which depended on a number of inter-related factors. The most important of these concerned the design and the dimensions of the test dome which it is necessary to attach to the pump, the position and the distribution of gas entry to this dome as well as the method and place of pressure measurement. The physical interpretation of speeds measured with various arrangements is discussed in relation to recent proposals of a test dome arrangement which forms the basis for an internationally agreed standard for pump speed specification.},

The bound contains two terms: One accounts for the short-ranged part of the interactions, giving rise to a bounded velocity and reflecting the persistence of locality out to intermediate distances, while the other contributes a power-law decay at longer distances. We demonstrate that these two contributions not only bound but, except at long times, \emph{qualitatively reproduce} the short- and long-distance dynamical behavior following a local quench in an $XY$ chain and a transverse-field Ising chain. In addition to describing dynamics in numerous intractable long-range interacting lattice models, our results can be experimentally verified in a variety of ultracold-atomic and solid-state systems.},

abstract = {We show that combined electrostatic and radiative fields can greatly amplify the directional properties, such as axis orientation and alignment, of symmetric top molecules. In our computational study, we consider all four symmetry combinations of the prolate and oblate inertia and polarizability tensors, as well as the collinear and perpendicular (or tilted) geometries of the two fields. In, respectively, the collinear or perpendicular fields, the oblate or prolate polarizability interaction due to the radiative field forces the permanent dipole into alignment with the static field. Two mechanisms are found to be responsible for the amplification of the molecules' orientation, which ensues once the static field is turned on: (a) permanent-dipole coupling of the opposite-parity tunneling doublets created by the oblate polarizability interaction in collinear static and radiative fields and (b) hybridization of the opposite parity states via the polarizability interaction and their coupling by the permanent dipole interaction to the collinear or perpendicular static field. In perpendicular fields, the oblate polarizability interaction, along with the loss of cylindrical symmetry, is found to preclude the wrong-way orientation, causing all states to become high-field seeking with respect to the static field. The adiabatic labels of the states in the tilted fields depend on the adiabatic path taken through the parameter space comprised of the permanent and induced-dipole interaction parameters and the tilt angle between the two field vectors.},

abstract = {Absolute values of the initial sticking coefficients of rare gas atoms (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) on a flat, clean Ru(001) surface have been determined with thermal beams and a highly sensitive thermal desorption method. The sticking coefficients increase with increasing mass of the atoms. Their decrease with increasing gas temperature is stronger the lighter the atom; different surface temperatures within the accessible range do not measurably affect the sticking efficiency. At a gas temperature of 300 K and a surface temperature of 6.5 K the initial sticking coefficients are 0.004 for Ne, 0.13 for Ar, 0.25 for Kr, and 0.71 for Xe. Forced oscillator calculations treating the substrate phonons quantum mechanically have been performed. With the well depths derived from experiment, and other reasonable input parameters, absolute values and functional forms of the sticking coefficients can be reproduced. The low values are due to the high elastic reflection probability which is a consequence of the inefficient energy transfer and the phonon quantization. The calculated Debye-Waller factors at zero gas and surface temperature are 0.92 for Ne, 0.36 for Ar, 0.14 for Kr, and 0.01 for Xe. A classical interpretation of the sticking data is impossible at least for Ne and Ar. {\textcopyright} 1992 American Institute of Physics.},

The ability to efficiently focus molecules depends on the properties of the molecular species of interest, the length of the hexapole state selector, as well as on the maxi-mum electric field strength that can be achieved in these devices. In particular for species with a small effective dipole moment such as nitric oxide (NO), hexapole state selectors of several meters in length are required to focus the beam. We report on a novel design for an electrostatic hexapole state-selector that allows for a maximum electric field strength of 260 kV/cm, reducing significantly the length of the hexapole that is required to focus the beam. We demonstrate the focusing of a molecular beam of NO radicals (X 2 1/2 , v = 0, J = 1/2, f) using a hexapole of only 30 cm length. A beamstop is integrated inside the hexapole at the geometric center of the device where the molecular trajectories have the largest deviation from the beam axis, effectively blocking the carrier gas of the molecular beam at minimum loss of NO density. The performance of the hexapole state-selector is investigated by state-selective laser induced fluorescence detection, as well as by two-dimensional imaging of the focused packet of NO radicals. The resulting packet of NO radicals has a density of 9 ± 3 × 10 10 cm −3 and a state purity of 99%.},

abstract = {We have measured the thermal contact conductance of several demountable copper joints below 1 K. Joints were made by bolting together either two flat surfaces or a clamp around a rod. Surfaces were gold plated, and no intermediate materials were used. A linear dependence on temperature was seen. Most of the measured conductance values fell into a narrow range: 0.1-0.2 WK-1 at 1 K. Results in the literature for similar joints consist of predictions based on electrical resistance measurements using the Wiedemann-Franz law. There is little evidence of the validity of this law in the case of joints. Nevertheless, our results are in good agreement with the literature predictions, suggesting that such predictions are a reasonable approximation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate the first molecular fountain, a development which permits hitherto unattainably long interrogation times with molecules. In our experiments, ammonia molecules are decelerated and cooled using electric fields, launched upwards with a velocity between 1.4 and 1.9 m/s and observed as they fall back under gravity. A combination of quadrupole lenses and bunching elements is used to shape the beam such that it has a large position spread and a small velocity spread (corresponding to a transverse temperature of < 10 $\mu$K and a longitudinal temperature of < 1 $\mu$K) when the molecules are in free fall, while being strongly focused at the detection region. The molecules are in free fall for up to 266 ms, making it possible, in principle, to perform sub-Hz measurements in molecular systems and paving the way for stringent tests of fundamental physics theories.},

Stark-decelerated hydroxyl (OH) radicals were scattered with hexapole-focused nitric oxide (NO) radicals in a crossed-beam configuration. Rotationally and spin-orbit inelastic scattering cross sections were measured on an absolute scale for collision energies between 70 and 300 cm(-1). These cross sections show fair agreement with quantum coupled-channels calculations using a set of coupled model potential energy surfaces based on ab initio calculations for the long-range nonadiabatic interactions and a simplistic short-range interaction.

Molecules placed in their first rotationally excited states are found to exhibit effective long-range repulsion for applied electric fields above a certain critical value, as previously shown for non-paramagnetic molecules. This repulsion can safely allow the molecules to scatter while reducing the risk of inelastic or chemically reactive collisions. Several molecular species of $^2\Sigma$ molecules of experimental interest -- RbSr, SrF, BaF, and YO -- are considered, and all are shown to exhibit orders of magnitude suppression in quenching rates in a sufficiently strong laboratory electric field. It is further shown that, for these molecules described by Hund's coupling case b, electronic and nuclear spins play the role of spectator with respect to the shielding.},

abstract = {Stark deceleration allows for precise control over the velocity of a pulsed molecular beam and, by the nature of its limited phase-space acceptance, reduces the energy width of the decelerated packet. We describe an alternate method of operating a Stark decelerator that further reduces the energy spread over the standard method of operation. In this alternate mode of operation, we aggressively decelerate the molecular packet using a high phase angle. This technique brings the molecular packet to the desired velocity before it reaches the end of the decelerator; the remaining stages are then used to longitudinally and transversely guide the packet to the detection/interaction region. The result of the initial aggressive slowing is a reduction in the phase-space acceptance of the decelerator and thus a narrowing of the velocity spread of the molecular packet. In addition to the narrower energy spread, this method also results in a velocity spread that is nearly independent of the final velocity. Using the alternate deceleration technique, the energy resolution of molecular collision measurements can be improved considerably.},

@article{Scharfenberg2009,
abstract = {With a Stark decelerator, beams of neutral polar molecules can be accelerated, guided at a constant velocity, or decelerated. The effectiveness of this process is determined by the 6D volume in phase space from which molecules are accepted by the Stark decelerator. Couplings between the longitudinal and transverse motion of the molecules in the decelerator can reduce this acceptance. These couplings are nearly absent when the decelerator operates such that only every third electric field stage is used for deceleration, while extra transverse focusing is provided by the intermediate stages. For many applications, the acceptance of a Stark decelerator in this so-called $s=3$ mode significantly exceeds that of a decelerator in the conventionally used ($s=1$) mode. This has been experimentally verified by passing a beam of OH radicals through a 2.6 meter long Stark decelerator. The experiments are in quantitative agreement with the results of trajectory calculations, and can qualitatively be explained with a simple model for the 6D acceptance. These results imply that the 6D acceptance of a Stark decelerator in the $s=3$ mode of operation approaches the optimum value, i.e. the value that is obtained when any couplings are neglected.},

abstract = {A surface-electrode decelerator consisting of 44 electrodes has been used to decelerate supersonic beams of helium Rydberg atoms moving with an initial velocity of 1200 m/s. Prior to the deceleration, the helium atoms were excited from the 1s2s 1 S 0 metastable state to selected Rydberg-Stark states with a narrow-band tunable UV laser. Complete deceleration could be achieved over a distance of 36 mm and in 60 $\mu$s, corresponding to an acceleration of −2.0 × 10 7 m/s 2 . After deceleration, the atoms were held in stationary electric traps above the chip surface, reaccelerated off the chip, and detected by pulsed electric-field ionization. The decelerator was also used to generate helium Rydberg-atom beams with a final velocity tunable between 0 and 1200 m/s. Transitions between low-and high-field-seeking Rydberg-Stark states were observed during trap loading and are attributed to adiabatic Landau-Zener dynamics at electric fields exceeding the Inglis-Teller field. By comparing the experimental results with the results of particle-trajectory simulations, the velocity distribution of the decelerated atoms was found to be characterized by temperatures ranging between 50 and 200 mK, depending on the magnitude of the electric dipole moment of the Rydberg-Stark states selected prior to the deceleration.},

@article{Shuman2010,
abstract = {It has been roughly three decades since laser cooling techniques produced ultracold atoms, leading to rapid advances in a wide array of fields. Laser cooling has not yet been extended to molecules because of their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules potentially useful for a wide range of applications. For example, heteronuclear molecules possess permanent electric dipole moments that lead to long-range, tunable, anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions. The combination of the dipole-dipole interaction and the precise control over molecular degrees of freedom possible at ultracold temperatures makes ultracold molecules attractive candidates for use in quantum simulations of condensed-matter systems and in quantum computation. Also, ultracold molecules could provide unique opportunities for studying chemical dynamics and for tests of fundamental symmetries. Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of the polar molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF). Using an optical cycling scheme requiring only three lasers, we have observed both Sisyphus and Doppler cooling forces that reduce the transverse temperature of a SrF molecular beam substantially, to a few millikelvin or less. At present, the only technique for producing ultracold molecules is to bind together ultracold alkali atoms through Feshbach resonance or photoassociation. However, proposed applications for ultracold molecules require a variety of molecular energy-level structures (for example unpaired electronic spin, Omega doublets and so on). Our method provides an alternative route to ultracold molecules. In particular, it bridges the gap between ultracold (submillikelvin) temperatures and the ∼1-K temperatures attainable with directly cooled molecules (for example with cryogenic buffer-gas cooling or decelerated supersonic beams). Ultimately, our technique should allow the production of large samples of molecules at ultracold temperatures for species that are chemically distinct from bialkalis.},

Assuming ''sufficient ergodicity'' (phase-space distribution only a function of energy) and s-wave collisions with an energy-independent cross section, an equation for the evolution of the energy distribution of trapped atoms is derived for arbitrary trap shapes. Numerical integration of this kinetic equation demonstrates that during evaporation the gas is accurately characterized by a Boltzmann distribution of atom energies, truncated at the trap depth. Adopting the assumption of a truncated Boltzmann distribution, closed expressions are obtained for the thermodynamic properties of the gas as well as for the particle and energy loss rates due to evaporation. We give analytical expressions both for power-law traps and for a realistic trapping potential (Ioffe quadrupole trap). As an application, we discuss the evaporative cooling of trapped atomic hydrogen gas.},

This points out a route towards preparing many body states and non-equilibrium quantum phases by quantum reservoir engineering. Here we discuss in detail the example of a \emph{driven dissipative Bose Einstein Condensate} of bosons and of paired fermions, where atoms in an optical lattice are coupled to a bath of Bogoliubov excitations via the atomic current representing \emph{local dissipation}. In the absence of interactions the lattice gas is driven into a pure state with long range order. Weak interactions lead to a weakly mixed state, which in 3D can be understood as a depletion of the condensate, and in 1D and 2D exhibits properties reminiscent of a Luttinger liquid or a Kosterlitz-Thouless critical phase at finite temperature, with the role of the ``finite temperature'' played by the interactions.},

abstract = {the slit SI was made so wide (7 mm) that the fission frag-ments entering through $2 could have all possible values of Hp. The figure clearly shows that, apart from a very few exceptions, the pulses of energies higher than 34 Mev are caused by fragments of the light, most energetic group, while the fragments of the heavy group correspond to pulses between 9 and 34 Mev; pulses of energies lower than 10 Mev are caused by coincidences between recoiling argon atoms. In the Hp-measurements the slit SI had a width of 1.0 mm and it was moved in steps of 1.0 mm; for the different positions of SI the number of fragments were counted, of course for equal neutron doses, and by means of the photographic record divided into two groups corre-sponding to the sizes of the pulses. In this way we get the number of fragments of each group as a function of the displacement of SI and we then calculate by means of the known magnetic field (which is not homogeneous) the Hp-distribution curves shown on Fig. 2. As seen, the two groups have nearly the same values of Hp, but the light group has evidently slightly higher Hp-values than the heavy one. Putting the most frequent value of mZ to 8.5&&10' mass unitsXMev' we get for the total charge of the light and the heavy group 20' and 22', respectively, when e denotes the electronic charge. This is in agreement with calculations by Professor Bohr' which predict an effective charge of fission fragments of about 20m. , yet the agreement is not perfect, as the theory involves a higher effective charge of the light group than of the heavy one in contradiction to the present experiments. Neverthe-less, it is no real disagreement; as pointed out by Professor Bohr in the paper, the total fragment charge need not be O NE of the most successful methods for accelerating charged particles to very high energies involves the repeated application of an oscillating electric field, as in the cyclotron. If a very large number of individual accelera-tions is required, there may be difficulty in keeping the particles in step with the electric field. In the case of the cyclotron this difficulty appears when the relativistic mass change causes an appreciable variation in the angular velocity of the particles. The device proposed here makes use of a "phase stabil-ity" possessed by certain orbits in a cyclotron. Consider, for example, a particle whose energy is such that its angular velocity is just right to match the frequency of the electric field. This will be called the equilibrium energy. Suppose further that the particle crosses the accelerating gaps just as the electric field passes through zero, changing in such a sense that an earlier arrival of the particle would result in an acceleration. This orbit is obviously stationary. To show that it is stable, suppose that a displacement in phase is made such that the particle arrives at the gaps too early. It is then accelerated; the increase in energy causes a decrease in angular velocity, which makes the time of arrival tend to become later. A similar argument shows that a change of energy from the equilibrium value tends to correct itself. These displaced orbits will continue to oscillate, with both phase and energy varying about their equilibrium values. In order to accelerate the particles it is now necessary to change the value of the equilibrium energy, which can be done by varying either the magnetic field or the fre-quency. While the equilibrium energy is changing, the phase of the motion will shift ahead just enough to provide the necessary accelerating force; the similarity of this behavior to that of a synchronous motor suggested the name of the device. The equations describing the phase and energy varia-tions have been derived by taking into account time varia-tion of both magnetic field and frequency, acceleration by the "betatron effect" (rate of change of flux), variation of the latter with orbit radius during the oscillations, and energy losses by ionization or radiation. It was assumed that the period of the phase oscillations is long compared to the period of orbital motion. The charge was taken to be one electronic charge. Equation (1) defines the},

abstract = {The long coherence times and strong Coulomb interactions afforded by trapped ion qubits have enabled realizations of the necessary primitives for quantum information processing (QIP), and indeed the highest-fidelity quantum operations in any qubit to date. But while light delivery to each individual ion in a system is essential for general quantum manipulations and readout, experiments so far have employed optical systems cumbersome to scale to even a few tens of qubits. Here we demonstrate lithographically defined nanophotonic waveguide devices for light routing and ion addressing fully integrated within a surface-electrode ion trap chip. Ion qubits are addressed at multiple locations via focusing grating couplers emitting through openings in the trap electrodes to ions trapped 50 $\mu$m above the chip; using this light we perform quantum coherent operations on the optical qubit transition in individual $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions. The grating focuses the beam to a diffraction-limited spot near the ion position with a 2 $\mu$m 1/$e^2$-radius along the trap axis, and we measure crosstalk errors between $10^{-2}$ and $4\times10^{-4}$ at distances 7.5-15 $\mu$m from the beam center. Owing to the scalability of the planar fabrication employed, together with the tight focusing and stable alignment afforded by optics integration within the trap chip, this approach presents a path to creating the optical systems required for large-scale trapped-ion QIP.},

In common with sources developed elsewhere, we have observed beam attenuation at low temperature as the helium flow through the nozzle is increased. A detailed analysis of the measurements demonstrates that direct backscattering in the nozzle-skimmer region is likely to be the major attenuation source. A numerical model, which describes the principle sources of scattering in the region between source and skimmer, is shown to provide a good description of the experimental data for a range of flow conditions and for stagnation temperatures between 37 and 300 K. The model includes partial accommodation of atoms scattered from surfaces of the skimmer and chamber, together with a realistic scattering potential. We use the model to predict the effect of various geometric alterations, aimed at improving the ultimate beam intensity. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

All uncertainties define 90% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

abstract = {Most natural processes that are of interest to us do not happen in an isolated en- vironment, they usually occur in some condensed phase. But in this state, many of the intrinsic (quantum) properties of molecules and atoms do not manifest themselves very clearly. Only in the gas phase and under certain particularly artificial conditions does it become possible to study in detail how atoms and molecules interact and what their intrinsic properties are. It is one of the ul- timate goals of the experimentalists to set up experiments that yield clear and unambiguous information about atoms and molecules with as few additional assumptions as possible and with a minimum of practical and theoretical com- plexity. In the best case, an experiment does not only yield new information which can be used by others, but is also a beautiful demonstration itself. Atomic},

abstract = {The transverse motion inside a Stark decelerator plays a large role in the total efficiency of deceleration. We differentiate between two separate regimes of molecule loss during the slowing process. The first mechanism involves distributed loss due to coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion, while the second is a result of the rapid decrease of the molecular velocity within the final few stages. In this work, we describe these effects and present means for overcoming them. Solutions based on modified switching time sequences with the existing decelerator geometry lead to a large gain of stable molecules in the intermediate velocity regime, but fail to address the loss at very low final velocities. We propose a new decelerator design, the quadrupole-guiding decelerator, which eliminates distributed loss due to transverse/longitudinal couplings throughout the slowing process and also exhibits gain over normal deceleration to the lowest velocities.},

However, realizing a highly degenerate quantum gas of molecules with a low entropy per particle has been an outstanding experimental challenge. In this paper, we report the synthesis of a low entropy molecular quantum gas by creating molecules at individual sites of a three-dimensional optical lattice that is initially loaded from a low entropy mixture of K and Rb quantum gases. We make use of the quantum statistics and interactions of the initial atom gases to load into the optical lattice, simultaneously and with good spatial overlap, a Mott insulator of bosonic Rb atoms and a single-band insulator of fermionic K atoms. Then, using magneto-association and optical state transfer, we efficiently produce ground-state molecules in the lattice at those sites that contained one Rb and one K atom. The achieved filling fraction of 25% indicates an entropy as low as $2.2\,k_B$ per molecule. This low-entropy molecular quantum gas opens the door to novel studies of transport and entanglement propagation in a many-body system with long-range dipolar interactions.},

The contact surfaces of the sample pairs were prepared with a 0.8 ??m lapped finish, while the finish of the aluminium washer was 0.2 ??m lapped. The contribution to the overall thermal impedance of the bulk conductance of the aluminium washer was negligible. It was found that conductance increased with both force and temperature; however, addition of the washer offered no significant conductance improvement over an uncoated single contact pair, any benefits from the gold plated washer being used to counteract the addition of two more contact surfaces. Additionally, the thermal conductance of a 'combination' aluminium sample pair having one gold coated and one uncoated surface was measured and compared to the augmented aluminium pair. The ratio of the conductance of the augmented aluminium pair to half the conductance of the 'combination' sample pair was found to be constant and near unity over the temperature range of the data obtained, within the limits of experimental error. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Although collisions between atoms and molecules are largely understood, collisions between two molecules have proven much harder to study. In both experiment and theory, our ability to determine quantum-state-resolved bimolecular cross-sections lags behind their atom–molecule counterparts by decades. For many bimolecular systems, even rules of thumb—much less intuitive understanding—of scattering cross sections are lacking. Here, we report the measurement of state-to-state differential cross sections on the collision of state-selected and velocity-controlled nitric oxide (NO) radicals and oxygen (O2) molecules. Using velocity map imaging of the scattered NO radicals, the full product-pair correlations of rotational excitation that occurs in both collision partners from individual encounters are revealed. The correlated cross sections show surprisingly good agreement with quantum scattering calculations using ab initio NO−O2 potential energy surfaces. The observations show that the well-known energy-gap law that governs atom–molecule collisions does not generally apply to bimolecular excitation processes, and reveal a propensity rule for the vector correlation of product angular momenta.},

@techreport{Chiaverini2004,
abstract = {Scalable quantum computation 1 and communication require error control to protect quantum information against unavoidable noise. Quantum error correction 2,3 protects information stored in two-level quantum systems (qubits) by rectifying errors with operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes. Error-correction protocols have been implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments 4-6 , but the inherent limitations of this technique 7 prevent its application to quantum information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate quantum error correction using three beryllium atomic-ion qubits confined to a linear, multi-zone trap. An encoded one-qubit state is protected against spin-flip errors by means of a three-qubit quantum error-correcting code. A primary ion qubit is prepared in an initial state, which is then encoded into an entangled state of three physical qubits (the primary and two ancilla qubits). Errors are induced simultaneously in all qubits at various rates. The encoded state is decoded back to the primary ion one-qubit state, making error information available on the ancilla ions, which are separated from the primary ion and measured. Finally, the primary qubit state is corrected on the basis of the ancillae measurement outcome. We verify error correction by comparing the corrected final state to the uncorrected state and to the initial state. In principle, the approach enables a quantum state to be maintained by means of repeated error correction, an important step towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation using trapped ions. Error-correcting codes that utilize entanglement to rectify unknown errors in qubits are an important ingredient for large-scale quantum information processing 1-3 (QIP). Owing to the fragility of quantum states, the presence of noise during both storage and entangling operations diminishes any gain achieved through the use of QIP without error correction. For example, the realization of long-distance quantum cryptography requires protection from the effects of noise on communication channels 8. In addition, quantum error correction will be necessary for applications of quantum computing such as efficient factorization of large numbers 1,9. It is notable that any of an infinite set of qubit errors can be corrected through quantum error correction by means of a finite set of unitary operations conditioned on measurement. Although there has been extensive theoretical research in the area of quantum error correction, experimental work has been limited to protocol process verifications by means of liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. These experiments 4-6 showed an increase in state fidelity after performing the unitary operations of an error-correction protocol, but using techniques known not to scale efficiently with the number of qubits 7. Furthermore, the ancillae cannot be reset in these experiments, whereas the experiment we describe provides this capability. In principle, the protocol demonstrated here can be repeated with the same qubits as many times as required by a particular quantum algorithm. We describe the implementation of a quantum error-correcting code (QECC) using three physical qubits, here denoted as the primary qubit and ancillae 1 and 2, to encode and protect one logical qubit from spin-flip errors (a p rotation around the x axis, in this case). Each qubit comprises two hyperfine states of a 9 Be þ ion and can be coherently manipulated by means of laser pulses 10,11. We implement the QECC by (1) preparing the state the primary qubit, (2) encoding this state into the logical state of all three qubits through use of an entangling operation, (3) applying an error rotation (that induces spin-flips upon measurement) to all three qubits, (4) decoding the logical state to the primary qubit, (5) measuring the state of the ancillae, and finally (6) applying correction operations to the primary qubit dependent upon the ancillae measurement outcome. The error correction is performed determi-nistically in every experiment. The results indicate that such methods, coupled with other recent experimental advances 11-14 , may lead to scalable QIP in a system of trapped ions. In contrast to the standard repetition code 2,3,15 , the QECC described and implemented here (see Fig. 1) can not be obtained by application of the superposition principle to a classical error-correction code. It is a stabilizer code 15 with stabilizer group generators {ZZX, ZXZ}. These generators are tensor products of Pauli operators (X ¼ j x , Z ¼ j z) operating on the qubits 1, 2 and 3. By calculation of the commutation relations of the generators with various error sets, it can be seen that as an error-detecting code, the QECC presented here detects not only spin-flips on any qubit but also a spin-flip or phase-flip on qubits 2 and 3. As an error-correction code, it will correct a spin-flip on any of the three qubits (the case for this work), but it can instead be used to correct a spin-flip on qubit 1 and a spin-flip or phase-flip on qubit 2 or qubit 3, for example. Another possible implementation can correct a spin-flip on qubit 1 and a phase-flip on either of the other two qubits. In the experiment, we use 9 Be þ ions confined to the axis of a multi-zone linear radio frequency Paul trap 11 similar to that described in ref. 16. The qubits comprise the electronic ground-state hyperfine levels jF ¼ 1; m F ¼ 21l and jF ¼ 2; m F ¼ 22l (denoted as j " l and j # l respectively, by analogy to the states of a spin-1 2 particle). Here F is the total angular momentum and m F is its projection along the quantization axis. The qubits are entangled with a three-qubit phase gate utilizing the ions' quantized axial vibrational modes 17 (see Methods section and Fig. 2b). Rotations},

In this paper we clarify different aspects of this technique by comparing experiments to detailed calculations. In the experiment, we produce cold guided beams of the three water isotopologs H2O, D2O and HDO. Their different rotational constants and orientations of electric dipole moments lead to remarkably different Stark shift properties, despite the molecules being very similar in a chemical sense. Therefore, the signals of the guided water isotopologs differ on an absolute scale and also exhibit characteristic electrode voltage dependencies. We find excellent agreement between the relative guided fractions and voltage dependencies of the investigated isotopologs and predictions made by our theoretical model of electrostatic velocity filtering.},

@article{Levinsen2011,
abstract = {We discuss the topological px+ipy superfluid phase in a two-dimensional (2D) gas of single-component fermionic polar molecules dressed by a circularly polarized microwave field. This phase emerges because the molecules may interact with each other via a potential V0(r) that has an attractive dipole-dipole 1/r3 tail, which provides p-wave superfluid pairing at fairly high temperatures. We calculate the amplitude of elastic p-wave scattering in the potential V0(r) taking into account both the anomalous scattering due to the dipole-dipole tail and the short-range contribution. This amplitude is then used for the analytical and numerical solution of the renormalized BCS gap equation which includes the second-order Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov corrections and the correction related to the effective mass of the quasiparticles. We find that the critical temperature Tc can be varied within a few orders of magnitude by modifying the short-range part of the potential V0(r). The decay of the system via collisional relaxation of molecules to dressed states with lower energies is rather slow due to the necessity of a large momentum transfer. The presence of a constant transverse electric field reduces the inelastic rate, and the lifetime of the system can be of the order of seconds even at 2D densities $\sim$109 cm-2. This leads to Tc of up to a few tens of nanokelvins and makes it realistic to obtain the topological px+ipy phase in experiments with ultracold polar molecules.},

@article{Zeppenfeld2012,
abstract = {Polar molecules have a rich internal structure and long-range dipole-dipole interactions, making them useful for quantum-controlled applications and fundamental investigations. Their potential fully unfolds at ultracold temperatures, where various effects are predicted in many-body physics, quantum information science, ultracold chemistry and physics beyond the standard model. Whereas a wide range of methods to produce cold molecular ensembles have been developed, the cooling of polyatomic molecules (that is, with three or more atoms) to ultracold temperatures has seemed intractable. Here we report the experimental realization of optoelectrical cooling, a recently proposed cooling and accumulation method for polar molecules. Its key attribute is the removal of a large fraction of a molecule's kinetic energy in each cycle of the cooling sequence via a Sisyphus effect, allowing cooling with only a few repetitions of the dissipative decay process. We demonstrate the potential of optoelectrical cooling by reducing the temperature of about one million CH(3)F molecules by a factor of 13.5, with the phase-space density increased by a factor of 29 (or a factor of 70 discounting trap losses). In contrast to other cooling mechanisms, our scheme proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions and should work for a large variety of polar molecules. With no fundamental temperature limit anticipated down to the photon-recoil temperature in the nanokelvin range, we expect our method to be able to produce ultracold polyatomic molecules. The low temperatures, large molecule numbers and long trapping times of up to 27 seconds should allow an interaction-dominated regime to be attained, enabling collision studies and investigation of evaporative cooling towards a Bose-Einstein condensate of polyatomic molecules.},

In order to use these beams in studies of\nreactions with controlled collision energies or in trapping experiments,\none needs a method of controlling the forward velocity of the beam. A\nStark decelerator can be an effective tool for controlling the mean\nspeed of molecules produced by supersonic jets, but efficient\ndeceleration of buffer-gas beams presents new challenges due to longer\npulse lengths. Traveling-wave decelerators are uniquely suited to meet\nthese challenges because of their ability to confine molecules in three\ndimensions during deceleration and their versatility afforded by the\nanalog control of the electrodes. We have created ground-state CH(X-2\nPi) radicals in a cryogenic buffer-gas cell with the potential to\nproduce a cold molecular beam of 10(11) molecules/pulse. We present a\ngeneral protocol for Stark deceleration of beams with a large position\nand velocity spread for use with a traveling-wave decelerator. Our\nmethod involves confining molecules transversely with a hexapole for an\noptimized distance before deceleration. This rotates the phase-space\ndistribution of the molecular packet so that the packet is matched to\nthe time-varying phase-space acceptance of the decelerator. We\ndemonstrate with simulations and an analytic one-dimensional model that\nthis method can decelerate a significant fraction of the molecules in\nsuccessive wells of a traveling-wave decelerator to produce energy-tuned\nbeams for cold and controlled-molecule experiments.},

abstract = {Molecular cooling techniques face the hurdle of dissipating translational as well as internal energy in the presence of a rich electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy spectrum. In our experiment, we create a translationally ultracold, dense quantum gas of molecules bound by more than 1000 wave numbers in the electronic ground state. Specifically, we stimulate with 80% efficiency, a two-photon transfer of molecules associated on a Feshbach resonance from a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms. In the process, the initial loose, long-range electrostatic bond of the Feshbach molecule is coherently transformed into a tight chemical bond. We demonstrate coherence of the transfer in a Ramsey-type experiment and show that the molecular sample is not heated during the transfer. Our results show that the preparation of a quantum gas of molecules in specific rovibrational states is possible and that the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules in their rovibronic ground state is within reach.},

abstract = {Atomic physics was revolutionized by the development of forced evaporative cooling, which led directly to the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum-degenerate Fermi gases and ultracold optical lattice simulations of condensed-matter phenomena. More recently, substantial progress has been made in the production of cold molecular gases. Their permanent electric dipole moment is expected to generate systems with varied and controllable phases, dynamics and chemistry. However, although advances have been made in both direct cooling and cold-association techniques, evaporative cooling has not been achieved so far. This is due to unfavourable ratios of elastic to inelastic scattering and impractically slow thermalization rates in the available trapped species. Here we report the observation of microwave-forced evaporative cooling of neutral hydroxyl (OH(•)) molecules loaded from a Stark-decelerated beam into an extremely high-gradient magnetic quadrupole trap. We demonstrate cooling by at least one order of magnitude in temperature, and a corresponding increase in phase-space density by three orders of magnitude, limited only by the low-temperature sensitivity of our spectroscopic thermometry technique. With evaporative cooling and a sufficiently large initial population, much colder temperatures are possible; even a quantum-degenerate gas of this dipolar radical (or anything else it can sympathetically cool) may be within reach.},

An effective molecular Hamiltonian including Stark and Zeeman terms has been constructed to describe single molecule dynamics inside the trap. Monte Carlo simulation using this Hamiltonian accurately models the observed trap dynamics in various trap configurations.

@article{Wall2010,
abstract = {In a Stark decelerator, polar molecules are slowed down and focussed by an inhomogeneous electric field which switches between two configurations. For the decelerator to work, it is essential that the molecules follow the changing electric field adiabatically. When the decelerator switches from one configuration to the other, the electric field changes in magnitude and direction, and this can cause molecules to change state. In places where the field is weak, the rotation of the electric field vector during the switch may be too rapid for the molecules to maintain their orientation relative to the field. Molecules that are at these places when the field switches may be lost from the decelerator as they are transferred into states that are not focussed. We calculate the probability of nonadiabatic transitions as a function of position in the periodic decelerator structure and find that for the decelerated group of molecules the loss is typically small, while for the un-decelerated group of molecules the loss can be very high. This loss can be eliminated using a bias field to ensure that the electric field magnitude is always large enough. We demonstrate our findings by comparing the results of experiments and simulations for the Stark deceleration of LiH and CaF molecules. We present a simple method for calculating the transition probabilities which can easily be applied to other molecules of interest.},

abstract = {Supersonic beams are a prevalent source of cold molecules utilized in the study of chemical reactions, atom interferometry, gas-surface interactions, precision spectroscopy, molecular cooling and more. The triumph of this method emanates from the high densities produced in relation to other methods, however beam density remains fundamentally limited by interference with shock waves reflected from collimating surfaces. Here we show experimentally that this shock interaction can be reduced or even eliminated by cryo-cooling the interacting surface. An increase in beam density of nearly an order of magnitude was measured at the lowest surface temperature, with no further fundamental limitation reached. Visualization of the shock waves by plasma discharge and reproduction with direct simulation Monte Carlo calculations both indicate that the suppression of the shock structure is partially caused by lowering the momentum flux of reflected particles, and significantly enhanced by the adsorption of particles to the surface. We observe that the scaling of beam density with source pressure is recovered, paving the way to order of magnitude brighter cold molecular beams.},

@article{Parazzoli2011b,
abstract = {Controlling interactions between cold molecules using external fields can elucidate the role of quantum mechanics in molecular collisions. We create a new experimental platform in which ultracold rubidium atoms and cold ammonia molecules are separately trapped by magnetic and electric fields and then combined to study collisions. We observe inelastic processes that are faster than expected from earlier field-free calculations. We use quantum scattering calculations to show that electric fields can have a major effect on collision outcomes, even in the absence of dipole-dipole interactions.},
