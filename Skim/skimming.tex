\chapter{Segregation}

As in many physical chemistry setups, the creation is all too soon marred and cast into disarray by a form of original sin, in this case segregation. Not all molecules are created equally, and so it is necessary to separate the wheat from the chaff, to separate those which are propagating in a nearly straight line from those for which the allure of the broad way that leadeth unto destruction has proven too strong. Typically, this is achieved by what is known as a molecular beam skimmer.
