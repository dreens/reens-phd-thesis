Here I include decelerator.py, a python module that enables more advanced switching schemes for Stark Deceleration. The code itself is already well-documented, but I will begin with some discussion of some important considerations. Historically, the most common technique for programming a decelerator was to simulate the propagation of the so-called synchronous molecule, and determine the length of each HV pulse by noting how long it took for this synchronous molecule to reach a certain phase angle within each given stage of the decelerator. This technique is conceptually very simple and appealing, but suffers from a few key practical limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item One has to guess the phase angle which will yield a certain final speed
\item The phase-angle to final speed correspondence will be highly sensitive to time-step and force-grid unless they are made extremely fine (nanosecond, micron)
\item Calculation time is long
\end{enumerate}
