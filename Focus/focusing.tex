\chapter{Strenuous Exertion}

And it came to pass that all those molecules who contrived to survive the great segregation described in the previous chapter, were set about a grueling and strenuous exertion of the mental faculties. Indeed, the focus requested of them was of such a severity as to literally bend their wills and their trajectories. And in more modern terminology, the subject of this chapter is the focusing of molecular beams for optimized coupling between their source and any further scientific requirements downstream.
