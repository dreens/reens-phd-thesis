\chapter{Skimming}
\label{chapter:skimming}

%As in many physical chemistry setups, the creation is all too soon marred and cast into disarray by a form of original sin, in this case segregation. Not all molecules are created equally, and so it is necessary to separate the wheat from the chaff, to separate those which are propagating in a nearly straight line from those for which the allure of the broad way that leadeth unto destruction has proven too strong. Typically, this is achieved by what is known as a molecular beam skimmer.
The creation was all too soon marred and cast into disarray.
Molecules whose trajectories led them into difficult circumstances, such as forceful impact with the chamber walls, did loudly proclaim their misfortune by initiating damaging shockwaves upon the entire population.
And so it became necessary to separate these malcontents from their fellows, and to restrict from access to the promised land all those who failed to follow the straight and narrow path that leadeth unto salvation.
The device chosen to perform this separation of straight line followers from their fellows, of the wheat from the chaff, became known as a molecular beam skimmer.

\section{Aerodynamic Skimming}

Traditional skimming techniques focus on shaping a trumpet-like structure in just the right way so as to minimize the chance of rejected molecules subsequently reentering the beam~\cite{Bossel1971,Bossel1974}.
To a good approximation, molecules encountering the surface may be assumed to leave with a cosine distribution of trajectories.
This cosine distribution also describes the the likelihood of a patch of surface being struck by particles in a gas above that surface.
For simple reasons of geometrical flux, a given patch of surface is more likely to encounter particles approaching along a normal to the surface, than at shallower angles, and quantitatively, the distribution function is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the normal and the actual line of incidence.
It follows that the same should be true for molecules exiting a surface, at least in the thermodynamic limit for a gas interacting with a surface.
For this reason it is advantageous to have the surface strongly tipped away from the beam, and to have the surface razor thin around its opening, so that as much as possible the molecules which interact with the skimmer are directed strongly away from the beam-line.
With this way of thinking, it might seem ideal to separate the beam with a very long hypodermic tube, but interactions with the inner surface of the skimming structure are also a concern.
Molecules impinge on the inner surfaces due to the inherent transverse temperature and spreading of the unperturbed beam, and also due to molecules which interact unfavorably with the tip of the skimmer, and for this region it is better to have the inside of the skimmer open up and not be shaped like a tube~\citep[Sec.~2.4]{Bossel1971}.
The precise details of the shape can be exactly computed in the case of a continuum flow of molecules~\cite{Campargue1984}, but since the advent of pulsed supersonic expansions, these details are no longer relevant since skimmers are no longer positioned in the regime of continuum flow of the valve, which only made sense with the much higher overall fluxes and much lower instantaneous fluxes of continuous beam sources.

\section{Cryogenic Skimming}

Cryogenic skimming can make a significant improvement to the situation thanks to the high probability of adsorption of molecules directly onto a cold surface, which much more thoroughly addresses the problem of separating unwanted molecules without their having an opportunity to negatively influence the others~\cite{Segev2017}.
Even in the case of incomplete sticking, a partial accommodation of molecules to the low temperature surface reduces their velocity, making it less likely that they will travel back into the beam before it has passed.
This work is thoroughly described in both our PCCP publication~\cite{Wu2018} and in Hao's thesis~\citep[Chap.~5]{WuThesis2019}.
I will focus here on the question of how these gains may best be transferred to the loading and operation of a Stark decelerator.
For this purpose, the key result worth recapitulating from our skimmer cooling work concerns the absolute comparison between the state of the art in room temperature skimming and that in cryogenic skimming, see Fig.~\ref{cryocommercial}.
A gain of nearly a factor of thirty is found in the improvement that results from the use of the cryogenic technique.
This gain may be understood to arise from a combination of ``geometric" and ``cryogenic'' gains, where the former refer to the reduction in valve-detector distance afforded by the reduced valve-skimmer distance and correspondingly increased solid angle, and the latter refers to the remaining gain directly associated with clogging mitigation.
It should be noted that this geometric gain is potentially suspect in the sense that at some point these gains correspond to molecules which may contribute to the increased spatial density observed after the skimmer but are too hot transversely to be loaded into the decelerator anyway.
To first order, this is not the case for the molecules which contribute to the observation in Fig.~\ref{cryocommercial}, since with a minimal detector transverse size for optimum density measurement, and an assumed $\sim\!2$~mm transverse effective initial source size, molecules hit the detector with a transverse velocity spread of:
\begin{equation}
\frac{2\text{ mm}}{8.4\text{ cm}}\times810\text{ m/s} = 19\text{ m/s}.
\end{equation}
By comparison, traditional deceleration accepts a spread closer to $10$~m/s, but $SF$ mode pushes this out to $18$~m/s, and $VSF$ out to $24$~m/s, see Fig.~\ref{phasespaceexamp}.

(b) Spatial hydroxyl radical density is measured after cryogenic and conventional skimmers with the valve-skimmer distance optimized for greatest density in both cases. A factor of thirty enhancement is observed.}{\linewidth}

\section{Decelerator Coupling}

Our first attempt at coupling molecules into the decelerator did not show a significant increase in signal upon cooling down the skimmer, as had been observed with the skimmer by itself.
This is a strong indication of clogging, since the cryogenic skimmers should feature severe clogging at room temperature due to their rather blunt shape.
The obvious hypothesis is that skimmer cooling was successfully mitigating skimmer clogging, but the increased flux through the skimmer simply led to decelerator clogging instead.
We first sought to address this through the use of modified skimmer geometries, which I will describe here, before moving on to more advanced strategies involving hexapolar focusing as described in the next chapter.

\subsection{Volcano Skimming}

\figdave{volcanoskim}{Volcano Skimmer Mechanical Drawing}{Mechanical drawing of the volcano skimmer, units are inches, $0.079" = 2$~mm. With a valve mounted right at $2-3$~cm from the skimmer tip, the optimum found with no decelerator, 9x reduced flux from $50\%$ hole diameter reduction and doubled distance of aperture to valve.}{\linewidth}

One obvious way to reduce the flux of molecules encountering the room temperature surfaces of the electrodes present in the Stark decelerator is to require the molecules of interest to go through a longer, narrower hole than previously.
To achieve this, we installed a modified skimmer which was essentially just a cone with a hole drilled through, see the mechanical drawing shown in Fig.~\ref{volcanoskim}.
Using na\"{i}ve solid angle arguments, this ought to have reduced flux onto the decelerator rods by more than an order of magnitude relative to the previous design.
In practice, the volcano skimmer also performed poorly, with no significant gain during cool-down.
One likely explanation for this is that the skimmer opening was too restrictive, and adsorption not complete enough to avoid clogging in this geometry.
To assess the relative contribution of volcano skimmer clogging and decelerator pin clogging, we also performed tests with Argon as a carrier gas.
This ought to have a significantly improved adsorption probability relative to neon, and could have led to a performance enhancement if clogging in the skimmer were truly to blame.
A comparable ratio of hot and cold temperatures with Argon was observed, suggesting that either both gases had rather poor first-bounce adsorption probabilities or that clogging on the decelerator pins remained the primary issue.

\subsection{Double Skimming}

This rather complex design was machined via CNC from a single block of 99.9995 (5N5) copper for high thermal conductivity. Dimensions are in inches, $0.039'' = 1$~mm.}{\linewidth}

Suspecting clogging in the volcano structure, we designed an alternative with similar flux reductions as far as the decelerator was concerned, but with much better egress options for limiting any clogging within the structure itself, see the mechanical drawing shown in Fig.~\ref{doubleskim}.
The device was designed to occupy a small space and integrate seamlessly with our existing mounting structure for quick manufacturing turnaround.
Essentially, a miniature skimmer was machined in one piece with an outer ring for soldering directly on to the back of another skimmer.
Any clogging associated with internal wall reflection in the volcano skimmer should be greatly reduced in the device, while enacting even stricter flux limitations thanks to the further reduced $1$~mm opening hole.
In practice, the device performed only slightly better than the volcano skimmer.
Our key figure of merit for performance is shown in Fig.~\ref{skimtodecelcomp}.
Here the detected OH molecules after guiding through the length of the decelerator are shown comparing the conventional room temperature skimmer to the volcano and double skimmers.
In stark contrast to Fig.~\ref{cryocommercial}, here only a loss is found between the conventional and cryogenic devices.

\figdave{skimtodecelcomp}{Skimmer Variations for Decelerator Coupling}{Several Skimmers are attempted, and none are found to improve upon the best guided molecule flux obtained via conventional skimming. The variation in arrival time of the measurements correspond to the different valve skimmer distances used in the various cases, and also to the variation in the initial speed of carrier gases between the case where Argon is used and the others. These data were collected on March 16 and April 26 of 2018.}{\linewidth}

\section{Lower Temperatures}

Some of our results suggested a performance that was still strongly improving as a function of further reduced temperature by the time our pulsed tube cryostat had reached its lowest temperature, see Fig.~\ref{lowtempsat}.
This motivated us to pursue a liquid Helium cooled skimmer, so as to achieve a further factor of two reduction in temperature, and potentially expose an even more dramatic gain in molecule number relative to what had already been observed.
These attempts did not lead to an improved performance, and were not reported in~\cite{Wu2018}, but some lessons worth sharing were learned.

\figdave{lowtempsat}{Low Temperature Trends for Cryogenic Skimming}{The low temperature behavior for cryogenic skimming shows a distinct lack of saturation, and a broadening of signal variation. Binning data by phase of the pulse tube cooler temperature variation reveals the strong role this plays. Results are somewhat encouraging of prospects for a lower temperature measurement.}{12cm}

One of our most surprising early observations was the wildly varying variance of the observed signal as a function of skimmer temperature. 
In fact, at first the observation was even more bizarre than what is shown in Fig.~\ref{lowtempsat}, where three distinct data branches were visible in the region between $35-20^\circ$K, as can still be seen in the experiment logbook.
This turned out to be an artifact of $60$~Hz noise on the thermometer spectrum, and is an interesting example of the ways that noise sources can interfere with data interpretation especially on a parametric plot.
In any case, with this issue easily filtered away, it also became clear that the broad variation in signal variance, especially between $20-8^\circ$K, was induced by the rather large $2-3^\circ$K amplitude temperature oscillations of the second stage of our Cryomech PT807 pulsed tube cooler.
Such fluctuations are not untypical of a purely copper system, which has a negligible heat capacitance in these temperature ranges, and therefore directly writes the fluctuating temperature of the cryogenic fluid onto the system of interest.
A similar observation was recently communicated~\cite{Lancaster2019}, and resolved through the use of a helium heat transfer stage interrupting the direct copper heat link.
We found a very strong dependence of the observed flux through the skimmer on not only the instantaneous temperature of the skimmer but whether it was in the midst of becoming colder or hotter.
It is a bit of a mystery why such a dependence would exist.
I spent some time searching for any reason that a time-lag might exist between the collection of OH signal and of cryostat temperature data, since this could masquerade as such a dependence, but nothing turned up.
Assuming the dependence is in fact real, one reason could relate to details of the adsorption process and of the surface layer on the cryogenic skimmer.
For example, bringing the adsorbed neon back up from its lowest temperature could function as an annealing step which changes the spring constant of the solid in a way that is more favorable for further adsorption.

}{\linewidth}

In any case, the observation suggests that lower temperatures could provide further benefit, as mentioned above.
I devised an unconventional flow type cryostat designed for bringing only the skimmer and a small thimble worth of liquid Helium down to low temperature.
The device is pictured in Fig.~\ref{flowcryoskimview}.
A long 1/2" SS tube protrudes deep into the vacuum chamber, such that a 3/8" OD helium fill line is able to protrude all the way down without making significant contact and while leaving room for cold Helium gas to escape back upwards, further cooling the fill line during egress.
In terms of manufacturing, the solder joint between copper and steel constitutes the most challenging step.
This was performed using a more aggressive ZnCl based flux, and required a few times to get right.
Another initial failure arose from the use of an UltaTorr fitting with gasket directly contacting the OD of the 1/2" tube.
This poor choice led to the freezing and failing of said gasket due to the cold Helium gas flowing just within.
A workaround was to use a 1" UltraTorr fitting to bridge the vacuum barrier and provide some position tunability, and connect a 1" tube to the thin walled 1/2" SS tube with the cold cryogen running through it via Swagelok, thereby leaving plenty of room to apply a heater for the gasket in between.
Further details are labeled in Fig.~\ref{flowcryoskimview}.

Several of the first attempts at transferring Helium to this device were fraught with major challenges, particularly with regard to temperature stabilization, which are worth discussing further here.
In our experiments with the pulse tube cooled skimmer, we often detected a strong sensitivity to whether or not the valve was operated during cool down.
In particular, it was found that operating the valve was actually crucial to the resulting performance of the system.
We were usually unable to recover the performance of the system without first heating close to room temperature.
This strongly suggests that the performance relates to the influence of water or other high temperature freezing species on the cryo-adsorption process for neon onto the copper skimmer.
For example, suppose that a layer of solid ice is actually detrimental to neon adsorption, and the formation of such a layer is the key process leading to reduced performance under some operating conditions.
This could explain the observed requirement of operating the valve during cool down, provided the regular bombardment of the skimmer surface with neon was sufficient to disturb the formation of such a layer.
It could also explain the observed failure to restore performance by partial warming, since warming only above the neon freezing point could actually be a very efficient way to help the water mixed in with the neon to settle down into a solid layer.

(c) Parametric plot showing strong hysteresis behavior in the sense that the observed signal depends not only on the instantaneous temperature but its time history.}{\linewidth}

In any case, during our first attempts with the Helium cooled skimmer, we inadvertently created a temperature bouncing phenomenon, see Fig.~\ref{lhebounce}.
The system temperature was found to erratically vary between $20^\circ\!$K and $5^\circ\!$K, as shown in panel (b) of Fig.~\ref{lhebounce}.
We hypothesize that this resulted from the situation where the narrow size of the copper reservoir allowed a bubble of Helium gas to sit between the base of the copper reservoir and the liquid Helium above.
The bubble would grow in size as the heat load on the skimmer continues to transfer to the Helium, until eventually the bubble would interrupt the flow of liquid helium out of the transfer tube and into the thin-walled stainless steel tube.
At this point, the liquid Helium working its way up between the transfer line and the thin-walled tube would quickly evaporate, allowing Helium gas to escape from the bubble above the reservoir and allowing new liquid helium to drop suddenly down on to the reservoir once more.
By increasing the pressure of Helium gas applied to the Helium dewar during the transfer, we were able to overcome this temperature bouncing mode of operation, although the pressures required ($5$~psi or so above room pressure) are very high as far as Helium dewars are concerned, which usually have relief valves at $10$~psi and very stern warnings about the dangers of overpressure.
The high pressures used for transfer also limit the temperature obtained at the skimmer, since the evaporation temperature of liquid Helium has a significant pressure dependence~\citep[Sec.~A]{Jensen1980}.

\section{Conclusions}

Although we have successfully demonstrated very significant gains associated with skimmer cooling on its own, leveraging these gains for deceleration has proven elusive.
A more reliable and robust method is desired for mitigating clogging not only in the skimmer but also in the ensuing coupling process to the decelerator.
While cooling of the decelerator itself certainly comes to mind as a possibility, the best blend of manufacturing plausibility and prospects for clogging mitigation were determined to be a cryogenic focusing hexapole, described further in the next chapter.
